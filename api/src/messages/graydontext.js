He was survived by his second wife, Esther Lorraine Gulliver Peoples (who passed away on December 16, 2023) and six children: Sara Jackman, Robert Peoples, Ruth Bradley, Arthur Peoples, Diane Blagg, Don Peoples, and two step-children Cathy Hill and Charles Hill, and a total of 25 grandchildren and 12 great grandchildren.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1939 Graydon enrolled in Iowa State College (later University) in Ames, Iowa in Aeronautical Engineering. He had completed 3 ½ years of Aeronautical Engineering before WWII. During that time he joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, was elected to Engineering Council and Cardinal Guild, the University Student Council. He was inducted into the Knights of Saint Patrick, an engineering society. In his senior year he was editor of the college monthly engineering magazine, the Iowa Engineer, which won first place national honors as a member of the national Engineering College Magazines Association.\n\nAt the outbreak of WWII he volunteered for induction, before graduation and was sent to Lincoln Air Base for Air Force Basic Training. On completion of training he was assigned to the 50th Signal Radio Intelligence Company where he was trained in German and then Japanese radio code interception and radio direction finding. During WWII he was assigned to an intelligence post near Washington, DC. In the Military District of Washington.\n\nAt the end of WWII he was honorably discharged from service and signed over into the Air Force Reserves so he wouldn’t be called back into the Signal Corps if another war broke out. Then he married Ruth Marie Wilson, of Morgantown, West Virginia, and mother of his six children. He returned under the G.I. Bill to Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. Since the aircraft industry and Air Conditioning (HVAC) field which was beginning to mature and was growing at a rapid pace.\n\nHe was employed by the Lennox Furnace Company (later Lennox Industries) in Marshalltown, Iowa and became chief engineer. He was awarded five United States Patents including #3,111,939, an industrial furnace that was used to heat structures in the Antarctic and was modified to de-ice antennas on the distant Early Warning installations north of the arctic circle. He also served as chairman of two industry standards committees and on three Underwriters Laboratory (UL) industry advisory conferences (IACs)for oil burners, oil furnaces and mobile homes. He was frequently called as an expert witness to testify in lawsuits related to fires and combustion of liquid and gaseous fuels.\n\nWhile still living in Iowa he joined the United States Power Squadrons, a national organization to teach boating safety courses to the general public and advanced courses such as Small Boat Piloting, Seamanship, Navigation, Marine Electronics and Engine Maintenance to its members. He was a Lieutenant Commander in both the Des Moines and Phoenix divisions of the U.S. Power Squadrons.\n\nHe was active in the Marshalltown, Iowa, community, serving on the school board, a camping organization, and as a deacon in the First Christian Church.\n\nAfter retiring from Lennox, Graydon and Lorraine moved to the Phoenix, Arizona, area. He was appointed by then Governor Bruce Babbitt to the Solar Energy Commission. He was then hired by the Salt River Project as a senior consulting engineer to head up their solar energy program. He retired from SRP on May 31, 1986.\n\nHe and Lorraine then travelled full time for 7 years in an RV, pulling a boat they had had built in Bellingham, Washington and could live aboard for weeks at a time. They visited all 50 states and boated most of the major rivers including the entire Mississippi, Columbia, St. Lawrence and Colorado River Chain of Lakes as well as the coastal waterways along the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nNext Graydon and Lorraine settled down in Chandler and Mesa retirement communities, San Tan Mobile Village and Fellowship Square – Historic Mesa.\n\nThroughout the years, he took part in two Mayo research projects. When hospitalized for five days in Sept. 2018, they diagnosed him with Mulltiple Myeloma, a bone cancer. Graydon Peoples, 98, of Mesa, AZ passed away on October 1, 2018.\n\n## Graydon Peoples memoirs ##\n\nRemembrances Graydon Peoples \n\nTo my children: Sara, Rob, Ruth Ann, Art, Diane and Don \n\nWhile visiting with Diane, this summer of 1988 she asked me to write down a kind of biography for all six of you, brothers and sisters. As I started to recall some of the events of years past and sorted through old photographs this kind of grew and grew and became more interesting. So this is to all of you but dedicated to Diane for giving me that extra push to get started. \n\nOur ancestry begins way back, even before the Flintstones. I have only traced ours back to my grandparents on both sides and to my great grandmother on my mother's side. So there's some work to yet be done to trace our genealogy farther back than that. Some day maybe I or one of you will tackle that task. This is written from memory, which was jogged by a few old photographs. I don't remember being born. However on good authority I am told that this event did take place at Women's Hospital in Detroit, Michigan on April 9, 1920. It was also reported that my parents were Earl Alphia Peoples and Sara (Sally) Pearl (Taphouse) Peoples, both of Detroit, Michigan. Here after they will be referred to as Moohre (I couldn't pronounce my th's yet) and Daddy, then later as Mother and Daddy. I procrastinated for more than 30 hours before entering this world. Then the decision was no longer mine to make and I was unceremoniously thrust into it. In fact some Doc took me by the ankles and whacked me across the butt. I took a deep breath and cried up a storm. It was humiliating and I never did find out why I deserved that kind of treatment. In those days they didn't have portable radios or TV. What crude radios there were required very elaborate antennas. So Daddy strung a bunch of wire back and forth across Moohre's hospital room ceiling so she and her roomie could listen to radio with earphones. Trouble was he slipped on the ladder and brought the whole array down on their beds. It seems that I just missed this event while accompanying some gorgeous nurse down the hallway on the way to the nursery. At this point I probably should fill you in a little on my family background. On Moohre's side I am half Danish and half English. Moohre's father's name was James Earl Taphouse, which seems like a refreshingly bubbly English name. He was born in Battle Creek, Michigan, home of Kellogg cereals. Later he became a dentist. I never did meet him since he and Grandma Taphouse parted ways years before I showed up. Grandma, on the other hand, was a very visible and loving part of my life until her death in the 1940's. Her maiden name was Karen Matilda Johnson, a purely Danish name. In fact her mother Kristen Johnson was married in Copenhagen, Denmark before she came to the United States. Grandma Taphouse was born in Boone, lowa. Both Grandma Taphouse and Great Grandma Johnson were six feet tall grand Dane dames. When I met Great Grandma Johnson she was in her 80s and had already began to shrink so I called her \"little grandma\" - that was after I learned to talk. Both Grandmas later lived in New York Mills, Minnesota, a Finnish- Danish town of 400 in the 1920s. In fact the only Finish newspaper in the country was printed in New York Mills. As for Moohre, she was a very attractive, intelligent and interesting housewife at the time I showed up. She was born in Elwood, Indiana on August 16, 1897 but grew up in Portland, Oregon. She did not have the opportunity to attend college but became the best self-educated lady that I have ever known. In Detroit she was a chief buyer for women's clothes at J.L. Hudson, the top department store, and later worked at Shean's book store where she collected many first editions and met many of the renowned authors of that time. At one time both she and Grandma Taphouse taught at a one-room country school in Colorado. They had to ride four miles on horseback to reach it. Daddy was born in Detroit, Michigan a few years ahead of me. The date was September 3, 1892. His father was Alphia Claudius Peoples, who was Scottish and his mother Mabel Sherwood was English. His father was a Detroit industrialist who owned a company which manufactured ceramic bathroom fixtures. Daddy graduated from both Oberlin College and Harvard University in investment banking but later became assistant sales manager of Packard Motor Car Company before joining his father in real estate ventures. He also served in WWI as a first lieutenant in the air arm of the Signal Corps. When he and his three sisters were young his father and mother took all on an around the world tour by steam ship. Such was unheard of in those days. Now back to me before I get any older. Let's see - I think I was about to kick the slats out of my cradle when I digressed about my ancestry. People had a habit of taking pictures of me without my permission or awareness of what was happening. You see I couldn't even talk very well yet. Oh well, here are some of little me photos taken about that time. They are of little me showing of Mohre, showing off Daddy, showing of Grandma, showing off my little sister and even showing off my fishes. My first real memories were of when I was somewhere about three or four years old. Some of these events I remember and some were told to me by Moore and Grandma. Since neither of them are here to correct me you may accept all of these events as hysterical if not historical fact. For some strange reason the first things I remember involved being in trouble. For instance Moohre had me all dressed up, I think, in a little sailor suit to go visiting. While waiting for her to get ready I went outside and played in the mud. This made her real unhappy so she decided to make me unhappy too. She cancelled our outing, which made me cry real hard but she wouldn't change her mind. So I learned that you can't change people's mind by crying - at least if you're a boy. Oh yes, by this time Barbara, my little sister that is 14 months younger, had gotten born. Didn't take her long - just popped into the world. She's kind of been popping in and out everywhere since. Well Moohre, one day, came up missing her table knives. When she found Barbara and me outdoors playing with them she asked me what we thought we were doing with the knives. I told her that we had them to cut our friends with. I never did find out if she bought the story but she sure let us know that that was unacceptable social behavior. Before I could talk real well I called Barbara \"My Barber\" She had kind of long blond hair. One day I decided to learn to use the telephone. In those days you just picked up the earpiece and an operator came on asking for \"Number please\". I told her \"My Barber needs a hair cut\" . That stopped the operator for a bit until Moohre came along and interrupted our conversation. At least I didn't give her a haircut. A neighbor boy my age and I used to play a lot together. We played with dolls, trucks and other toys. Trouble was that he also used to play that we had a fight and flattened me and pushed me around. It got real annoying. Even crying didn't seem to help any more than it did to change Moohre's mind. I got to thinking about this. So one day, while we were playing real nice, I turned him around and flattened him with a right hook. He went home crying. Then we became good friends and he never played \"fight\" after that. That's him on the left and me on the right in the picture. Probably the saddest lesson I learned was about other living things and compassion. Moore and Daddy gave me a little kitten. One day, while in the garage, I played catch with the kitten by tossing it up in the air and catching it. Sometimes I missed catching it and it landed on the concrete floor. Then it started to bleed around the nose. About that time Daddy came out to see what I was doing. By that time it was too late. He loaded the kitten and me in the car with the kitten on my lap and drove to the animal rescue shelter. There I had to watch while the kitten was put to sleep. I felt crushed. That's why, to this day, I cannot stand to see an animal hurt or mistreated. It even makes me feel bad to catch a fish and I would never shoot a duck or go hunting except with a camera. Inanimate objects are different. Grandma had a house in Grand Junction, Colorado. During the summer I would sometimes spend a few weeks with her. One day, while we were walking across a bridge over the Colorado River I asked Grandma if I could carry her purse for her. She handed it to me. Halfway across the bridge I tossed it over the rail into the roaring river. I don't remember whether or not it was premeditated but for a moment it sure was devilish fun. The purse was swept up in the current and carried under the bridge. Grandma yelled to a man nearby who saw the crime being committed. The purse was carried by the swirling waters up onto a rock near the shore where it balanced precariously. The man found a long pole which he looped through the purse handle and retrieved it. I can still see the folding money and railroad tickets clipped to the cloths line to dry. I don't remember if I got punished or not because Grandma used to think I could do no wrong. I do know that she never let me carry her purse for her again. Another place Barbara and I used to visit was the Little Grandma's house in New York Mills, Minnesota. New York Mills was a Finnish-Danish community of about 400 northwest of Minneapolis and in Ottertail County. It had all dirt streets and was on the Chicago and Great Western Railroad main line. Great Grandma's house was really neat. It didn't have electricity— only Kerosene lanterns for light. It did have a pump organ, which I had trouble playing because the pump pedals were to far away for me to reach with my feet. Outside was a complete garden, orchard and chicken house. Cooking and heating were by burning wood in old fashioned cast iron wood stoves. One day I was crawling along the kitchen floor when my head collided with the lower cast iron door on the cooking stove. Guess I bled like a stuck pig and probably squealed like one. Grandma carried me to the Doc's house about a block away where I got sewed up. I still have the scar mark near the front of my hair part line. I always liked to experiment so one day, when I was a little older, I got a big long nail and hammer. I pounded the nail into the side of Great Grandma's house. After three or four whacks I ran inside to see if the nail had come through yet. Grandma Taphouse became curious so asked me what I was doing. I told her but she let me continue. The nail never did come through which led me to believe that the nail may have been too short or the wall too thick. The Great Northern Railroad ran through New York Mills. It was a favorite stop for hobos. They had special marks they'd leave on telephone poles, near people's doors to let the next hobo who came along who the soft touches were for handouts. In those days hobos were pretty high class. One of the fun activities was going down to the railroad depot with Grandma to meet the train when it came in. One time Grandma was checking on some schedules when I slipped outside. When I turned up missing I guess everyone started searching for me, including the train's engineer who wouldn't start the train until he knew where I had gone. I'd crawled under the steam engine to see what it looked like underneath. The engineer found me there and then took me up into the cab of the engine and showed me how everything worked. Guess that's when I decided to become an engineer. One thing that bothered me was the way Grandma would cut of a chicken's head. She'd ax it off on a stump and then the headless chicken would fly clear across the yard before it realized what had happened. I saw her do it once but I could never could watch after that. Grandma also had a Guinea hen who had some cute little chicks. One day I picked up one of the little chick to pet it. It sure made the old hen mad because she flew up onto my head, grabbed a hunk of hair in her claws and proceeded to beat the sides of my head and ears with her wings. I dropped the chick and went hollering and running across the yard but she stayed up there beating away. I don't know how I shook her loose but I never did go near those chicks again. Mother did a lot of interesting traveling and generally took Barbara and me along. For several years, while I was still preschool age, she took us from Detroit to our summer home in Grand Junction, Colorado. In fact it seemed like I grew up on a train and in a Pullman car and diner. Mother had kind of a drawing room setup. One night, in Denver, the train made a stopover. Mother left Barbara asleep in her bunk and took me into the station to get some refreshments since there was plenty of time. When we returned, the train was gone. Mother found the trainmaster who informed her that some of the cars were going through the car wash. Sure enough we watched our car come out of the spray shed with Barbara still asleep in her bunk. The most fun was going through the Royal Gorge in Colorado. It took two steam engines to pull some of the grades. When we got down into the bottom of the Gorge, along the Colorado River, the train would stop and let everyone out to enjoy the scenery. The railroad tracks were just a few feet above the roaring, turbulent, Colorado River. A fenced walkway was along side the tracks to keep us out of the river. On the other side of the train, the shear sides of the gorge went straight up for about three fourths mile. Later they built a suspension bridge over the gorge and named it, appropriately, the \"Hanging Bridge\" I don't remember a lot about Grand Junction except that Daddy leased a store and started a little restaurant just to have something to do. I don't see how it could have made much money. Also mother brought our maid with us from Detroit. She was part white and part colored and quite beautiful. Since she passed for white she always had white suitors. This presented a problem for her and I remember that she tried to commit suicide twice while we were in Grand Junction. Once she got ready to jump into the Colorado River but lost her nerve. The second time she tried to stick her tongue into a live light socket while laying on the bed but it didn't work because she wasn't well enough grounded. I didn't know enough about electricity, at that time, to advise her of this fact. Later, back in Detroit, she met a fellow who was half colored. They got married and then we lost track of her. One summer, when I was still preschool age, Mother took me to a lake in Michigan. I think it was Round Lake or it may have been Orchard Lake. We stayed in a big rustic lodge. During the Day Mother often played golf while I played with the other kids in the nursery. Sometimes we went out in a rowboat on the lake. One day I rowed mother most of the way around the lake, even as small as I was. Apparently the exertion was too much for me and I got really sick. Back in Detroit the doctor diagnosed me as having TB. A ways outside of Detroit, in Northfield, Michigan there was a well known TB sanitarium. Mother and Daddy put me in the sanitarium to be treated and cured. I was there for almost one year. It was kind of traumatic but I learned to adapt and make new friends. I was put in a large ward with children about my age. Many were there for other reasons than TB. One boy, who became a good friend, was paralyzed from the neck down and in a partial cast. I spent a lot of time by his bedside visiting and playing and remember crying myself to sleep at night for him. Sometimes I felt as if I cared enough I could will him back to health. See the picture of me at his bedside with clowns around us who were there to cheer us up. We weren't permitted to run, do anything strenuous and were on strict nutrition and lots of fresh air. They had great big carbon arc sunlamps that we laid in front of periodically with sunglass goggles on. I remember that during the holidays they had a circus and clowns to entertain us in the dining room. A photographer held up a big scoop of powder which he set of to provide a flash for his pictures. It sure made a bang and left a big puff of smoke. That's why I'm holding my ears in the picture. We also had outdoor fairs and booths which the older adult patients manned and entertained us with. I remember one day when the entire dining room ceiling came loose in big chunks and fell on the tables. Fortunately no one was in there at the time. Mother and Daddy and Barbara came and visited me real often and I was sure glad to see them. Apparently the nursing care and diet worked well because I did get well and even a little chubby, as you can see in these two pictures taken at Northville. This is where Mother and Daddy met Dr. Max Pinner, who was head of the sanitarium, and his wife Behrna and the supervising nurse, Ruth Oaks, all of whom became close friends of the family and who were a part of our lives long after I left the sanitarium. In fact Max and Behrna taught me how to play chess and bridge as a little guy. It was quite a day when I got to go home and begin leading a normal kid's life again. It was a different house than I last remembered and I don't remember where it was located in Detroit. In the meantime I hadn't gone to school but kind of learned to read on my own. About three months after we moved in I came down with Polio. It was often called Infantile Paralysis. When I got sick our family doctor was out of town so they sent another doctor to the house. His name, as I recall, was Dr. Herman Kohl. It turned out that he was one of just a handful of doctors in the nation that had handled any number of polio cases so he was able to diagnose it immediately. He did a spinal tap to relieve the pressure on my spine and then put me in quarantine at home. I was assigned a fulltime live-in nurse. She decided that the books I was reading were too old for me so she took them away from me. They were the classic books that I had learned to read by myself. Later Mother explained it to her so I got the books back. I didn't suffer any paralysis but for about one year had the outer edges of my shoe heels shaved off a little bit. Finally the day came when the quarantine was lifted and I was allowed to go outdoors. About three days later I was pumping along in front of the house with my coaster wagon when a dog came up and bit me in the leg. Fortunately they located the dog before I had to start the Pasteur treatment which can be unpleasantly painful. The dog was not rabid. However, I think Mother was about ready to trade me in. It seems that we lived in a lot of different places when I was little. One I remember was a luxury second floor apartment in Detroit. Mother had a concert grand piano in the sunroom. That's about all I can remember about the apartment. One evening I turned up missing. Mother had everyone out looking, including the police. When they found me I was heading back home with my wagon. Mother asked me where I'd been. I told her that I was \"in the woods practicing to be brave\" Granpa, Alphia Claudius Peoples' house was on Grand Boulevard just east of Grand River Avenue. It was a huge mansion. Grandma, Mabel Sherwood Peoples had one of those electric cars with the flower pots on each side of the windshield. It was fun to ride in. I don't remember an awful lot about Grandma and Grandpa except for one Christmas at their house when I got a battery operated electric train that I was too young to really appreciate or show a lot of interest in. By the way - Daddy wanted to name me Alphia Claudius after Grandpa. Mother rebelled but agreed to the Alphia. She must have picked the name Graydon out of thin air since it wasn't a family name. She told people that they happened to be gradin' first street in front of our house when I was born so that's where it came from. When I got older the other boys teased me about my first name sometimes calling me Alphiew Pew. So from then on I dropped it and just used Graydon figuring it was all I needed. However, when I was little, up to about eight or nine everyone called me Buddy and then Bud. Grandma Taphouse sometimes called me Hi Pockets. In the early 20's cars had soft tops with metal frameworks and canvas or similar materials and most were convertible. Mother got one of the first hard top cars in Detroit. It was solid metal except for the very center of the roof making it safer. One day Mother was driving with the maid and little Barbara somewhere. She got on a gravel road, went of on the shoulder and then turned the car over. Everyone got out okay except for some minor battery acid burns. It was used as a testimonial for the safety of a hard top car by the manufacturer. Well that's about all that comes to mind up to the time I first started school in the second grade. By then we had moved to 16163 Sunderland Avenue in North Rosedale Park which is located between Grand River Avenue and Six Mile Road - later renamed McNichols Road. We lived in a two story brick house with full basement. Cooke Elementary School was just one block away. This was when I was about seven and began a two or three year period of stability and normalcy in my life. Rosedale Park was really neat. It consisted of about 600 homes and included a civic center area that had a big clubhouse, park, swimming pool and playground. The whole community was organized by streets with each street fielding a men's baseball team and other activities. Each year we had a big parade and everyone made floats including little kids on their decorated tricycles up to floats by the major automobile companies. It was because some General Motors, Ford and Packard executives lived in the park. Cooke School was one of those big traditional brick, two story elementary schools of that day. A central hallway ran the full width of the school with classroom front and rear off the hallway and a stairway at each end. Our principal was Miss Ketchum and the second grade teacher was Mrs. Lancaster. She had gotten married after we started school and I remember the kids referring to her as Mrs. Canlaster— of course behind her back. I enjoyed my first crush on a girl that year. Her name was Patricia Forrester. She was cute and with a great personality. She apparently liked me too. One day, while we were passing in line, we kind of nudged each other. Mrs. Lancaster (Canlaster) saw it. After we got back to the classroom she made me get up in front of the class and apologize to Patricia. It was a very humiliating experience for both Patricia and me. We still liked each other but I was sure careful after that about bumping into girls. Maybe this was the beginning of this whole sexual harassment kick. In either the second or third grades we started to learn penmanship. Those were the days when we had quill type pens and inkwells. We had an exercise book that we used to imitate by making the same circles and shapes of letters over and over again as shown in the book written by a guy named Palmer. Apparently I was blessed with pretty good eye-hand coordination because I was able to sail right through the book. In fact I was having so much fun with it that I went through the book three times while the rest of the class was going through it once. Then when the course was over I started experimenting with my own handwriting style just to be different. One of the gym classes we had once or twice a week was dancing. This is a public school? We learned the Virginia Reel and some square dances as well as the Waltz, Two Step, Fox Trot, etc. I remember going to my first dance at the Rosedale Park Clubhouse when we got all dressed up and our parents drove us to the clubhouse. They were emphasizing the social skills then. Of course we also had soccer teams and played baseball for physical education. In fact baseball was the king of sports in Detroit and a lot of times we had members of the Detroit Tigers baseball team come out to Cooke School to put on demonstrations. In the winter time we'd turn hoses onto vacant lots and make skating rinks. Ice Hockey was another great Detroit sport. We little kids would play hockey on our vacant lot rinks. Every high school had a hockey team and we had two professional teams in Detroit, the Red Wings and the Olympics. It was during this time that I got my first bicycle. We didn't have training wheels in those days so Mother trotted along beside me holding me upright while I got the feel of peddling and steering. We were going along one time in front of the house at our end of Sunderland Rd. Mother let go and I kept going and stayed upright. I kept going that way in a straight line for about three quarters of a mile to the other end of Sunderland. When I tried to turn around I fell of the bike and couldn't get back on. So I walked the bike all the way back home. After a couple of more days of practice I really had bike riding down pat and from then on had a hard time staying off one. Some other neighborhood boys and I kept looking for new bike challenges. One was to set endurance records for staying up on the bike without touching feet to the ground for the longest time. We'd go around a preset course within the park. At preselected checkpoints we'd ride around in circles while getting a drink of water or lunch from our \"officials\". Another challenge was to ride around in circles within the confines of the two curbs for the greatest number of times literally hundreds. Sometimes the circles had to become ovals when a car came along. One of the nicest things about living in the house on Sunderland was having my own room. It was an upstairs bedroom at the front corner of the house where I could look out over the street across to a vacant play lot and see Cooke School a block away. The room was all decorated in a nautical theme and I had a beautiful model of the Santa Maria setting on my dresser. I had a little desk where I could read, write and build models and plot new adventures. We had a coal fired hot water furnace with the old-fashioned cast iron radiators in each room. I remember one time not feeling quite up to going to school so I told Mother that I was sick. She had me lay down on my bed and stuck a thermometer into my mouth. While she was out of the room I held the thermometer over the radiator to warm it up and give me a fever. You should have seen her expression when she saw that I had a 105-degree fever. Then she put her hand on my forehead which was as cool as a cucumber. After some interrogation I ended up going to school that day. I remember helping to haul out the ashes to the curb for pickup about once each week during the winter months. We had metal bushel baskets to put the ashes in. It took two of us to haul a basket of ashes up out of the basement. Mother and Daddy did a lot of entertaining so Barbara and I met many interesting people. I especially remember the writers and artists. Some were on the staff of the American Boy magazine. They gave me the oil painting of buffaloes that had appeared in one of the American Boy stories. It was in my room and later Mother had it hanging over her davenport in the living room. Another picture was a watercolor of Byrd's flight over the South Pole, which had appeared in a Cadillac motor car ad and is now in my study. One night a guest used my bedroom and left me a gift of a Buddy L tool box along with a thank you note. In the evening, before going to bed, Barbara and I were taught to go around the group of guests, call each by name and curtsy and bow good night. Mother took Barbara and me to the World Adventure Series of lectures that were organized by a Detroit civic group. We heard travel lectures by Admiral Byrd, Roy Chapman Andrews, Lowell Thomas and many other world travelers of the time and then got a chance to meet them. She also took us to the children's series put on by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Of the events I remember the most were the trips to air shows and air meets. Mother served as the hostess for some of the pioneer air shows in Detroit. During that time I got to meet Amelia Earhart and Wiley Post and sit in the planes that they were taking delivery on in Detroit. That is where I got my first ride in a Ford Trimotor airplane. It sure was tinny and noisy and kind of scary. I guess that's why they called it the tin goose. Bill Stout, one of the aviation pioneers, designed and built the Stout Scarab which was half car and half airplane. You could take off the wings and drive away. Anyway that's when I decided to become an Aeronautical Engineer. Fisher Body Corporation made all of the bodies for General Motors cars in those days. They had a competition to build a model of a stage coach, which was the trademark of Fisher Body. This competition was called the Fisher Body Craftsman's Guild. The models were magnificent and the winners received college scholarships, as I recall. There was also competition to build scale model airplanes from scratch that also awarded scholarships. These airplane models were unbelievably detailed and then covered with clear tissue so one could see every rib, strut, wire and control in the plane. Most of the famous aviation people of that day acted either as judges or attended the shows. It was an exciting time. I then decided that rather than get married I was going to grow up and get an airplane. I started building flying scale model airplanes. The first was a glider. Mother critiqued it for me each step of the way. She was my quality control. When I graduated to rubber band models Mother would sit down with me and show me how to whittle a propeller out of a block of balsa wood until one could virtually see through the propeller blade. Weight was most important. We had a huge coliseum in Detroit where an indoor endurance model airplane contest was held each year. The idea was to build a rubber band powered airplane that could stay aloft in the coliseum for the longest period of time. The rubber band, which stretched from the tail to the propeller in front, was wound up using an egg beater until it could be wound no longer and then attached to the propeller. Entrants were from around the country and from some foreign countries. I remember one year when the winner's father, it turned out, was president of a rubber company and formulated a special rubber for his son's rubber bands. I don't remember whether or not that disqualified his. The planes were feather light and were designed so that the propellers rotated just one revolution every second or two. The two or three vacant lots behind our house, on Sunderland, were pure sand dunes. They were great fun to play in. At one period of time a bunch of us chose up sides and decided to play World War 1. We dug slit trenches and command post dugouts in the sand, donned some old WW1 helmets we scrounged up, strung wire and took our BB guns and started our battle. We even put snipers up in some nearby trees. Our parents made us declare a truce when they found out that we were shooting BBs at each other so we were never able to find out who won. When we first moved to Sunderland, Mother and Daddy brought home a pure white Saint Bernard puppy for me, and I'm sure, Barbara also. We looked at the map of Switzerland and found a town named Bosco so we named the Saint Bernard, Bosco. Jack Deslaires, a neighborhood buddy of mine and I decided to build a special wagon for Bosco to pull us around in and to harness train him. The trouble was that Bosco got sick with distemper and had to go to the dog hospital. We went ahead and finished the wagon for when Bosco came home. One day they called Mother to come pick him up. While she was getting ready they called back to say that Bosco had died. It came as such a shock that she never did go down to check to see if this was true. He was a rare, all white Saint Bernard so there may have been some funny business going on. To ease the disappointment Mother and Daddy took me down to the animal shelter to pick out another dog. One of the first ones I saw was a mangy brown dog with tight ringlet curls, a hard hairless tail and floppy ears. We, he and I, fell in love at first sight. They couldn't talk me our of it so we brought him home. It turned out that he was a pure bred Irish Water Spaniel. His name was Jiggs. He became such a great specimen that later people wanted to borrow him for breeding purposes. The first time we got to take the pick-of-the-litter as payment. So we ended up with a second little water spaniel we named Little Jiggs. See picture of both of them. This is the end of the first installment or chapter. I will follow up with the others later. Love, • Dad REMEMBRANCES (continued) Now let's see-where was I? Oh yes, Jiggs had just come into my life. I should say our lives since he took advantage of the whole family. He was mostly an outdoor dog but one who liked attention from indoors. Sometime he drove Mother up a wall by laying by the front door and wagging his hard tail against the door just like someone was knocking. Then there was the time when Mother was about to leave the house to run some errands when Jiggs came limping up to her with one of his paws held off the ground. She looked and looked for a burr or thorn but couldn't find one. She finally decided to go run her errand and call the vet when she go home. Upon her return Jiggs came running at full gallop to greet her, his paw healed, the faker. We had a mean little kid down the block named Bobby Langlois. I kind of ignored him and he never did bother me. He had a bad habit of shooting things with his BB gun. One day Jiggs was walking beside me when he spotted Bobby and with a growl started to take out after him. I reined him in but figured that Bobby had shot him with his BB gun. I simply told Bobby that the next time he shot at Jiggs I'd just let Jiggs take care of him. That ended that. Those years were what we called the \"Roaring Twenties\" Prohibition was in full swing. I was too young to drink so I didn't take sides on the issue. Some neighbors got together and made their own \"bathtub gin\". I know Mother wouldn't allow such a thing at our house but I think Daddy kind of cooperated with the neighbors in this moonlight activity. One night Daddy and Mother got Barbara and me up at about three o'clock in the morning and took us outdoors. When we looked up in the sky there was the Graf Zeppelin gliding directly overhead, all lit up in a blaze of glory. What a sight. At that time Mother had a young lady, Jeanette Breigen, during the days and sometimes overnight to do some work around the house and watch over Barbara and me. Jeanette was a beautiful girl of Dutch ancestry and came from a family of very meager means. Mother provided her with some nice clothes and did extra things for the family. Jeanette was really popular with the kids in the neighborhood. She would sit on our front porch steps and read us exciting stories by the hour, mostly the classics like Swiss Family Robinson. She also played baseball with us in the vacant lot across the street. About that time someone bought our sand dunes behind our house and started to build a big house on it. During the construction we had a lot of fun playing in it. We made wooden swords and had swashbuckling duels up and down the half- finished stairways. During one of these duels I backed into an open stairwell over the basement and fell through. Luckily there was a soft dirt mound of dirt at the bottom. Our electric utility was the Detroit Edison Company. They had a policy of replacing light bulbs, electric stove elements and things like that free of charge. I guess they figured that they couldn't sell electricity for a burned out bulb. One day Mother gave me some burned out bulbs to exchange at the local Detroit Edison appliance retail outlet. While there I saw a beautiful wooden electric clock and decided to give it to Mother for her birthday. The trouble was that my allowance was only 25 or 50 cents per week. I did have some saved up. The store manager agreed to take what 1 had saved as a down payment and then half of the rest of my allowance each week until it was paid off. Sure took a long time. Mother loved the clock. When I was nine or ten at about 1929 or 1930 things started to come unraveled between Mother and Daddy. They argued a lot, although I really didn't understand what it was all about and really didn't care to know. She told me that I said \"Don't worry Mother, I'll take care of you\". Finally we had to move out of the house and Rosedale Park to a rented apartment about five miles closer to town and just off Grand River Avenue. Daddy had lost the house to pay off some kind of debt. Maybe it was from playing the stock market. The hardest part was having to place Jiggs in a new home since dogs weren't allowed in the apartment. Later I heard that on several occasions Jiggs had run away from his new home and showed up at our old house on Sunderland looking for us. I'm sure glad I didn't know at the time. As for Little Jiggs, we had found him a new home some time ago and I heard that he turned out to be a terrific duck hunter's retriever. I guess I treated each new experience as an adventure so was able to roll with the punches and disappointments. During the short time we lived in the apartment, about one year, I made new friends and got involved in the Methodist Church activities about a block away. In fact I went the entire year with a perfect Sunday School attendance. Two of my closest new friends were brothers, Junie (Harry Jr.) and Bob Vibbert. That friendship lasted for many years. We played a lot of baseball and soccer together and loved to listen to radio. Bob was a great Tarzan fan and wanted to grow up swinging from the trees and doing all of the Tarzan things. We also listened avidly to programs such as the Lone Ranger, Fibber McGee and Molly, Jack Benny, Amos and Andy and let our imaginations fill in the pictures. Many years later, when television came into being, the pictures weren't nearly as colorful and dynamic as those conjured up by our own imaginations. Bob was the more serious one and Junie had the great sense of humor. Their father was vice-president of Hygrade, a large Detroit meat packing company. One day, in school, the teacher asked each of us what our fathers did for a living. Junie said his father stuck pigs. It was said that when they were little Junie had a problem sucking his thumb and Bob had a bed-wetting problem. I remember one day being at Bob and Junie's house when their grandmother was visiting them. Bob told her that he had a dream the night before and that he was a captain leading his company on a charge while riding his white horse. Then, as an afterthought, he said \"and my thumb sucking brother was along\" \". Immediately Junie said \"Grandma, I had the same dream and you know what— just as we were about to charge into battle the captain wet his horse\" On hot evenings we all went up to the apartment rooftop to keep cool. Those were the days before air-conditioning. One evening someone started tickling feet. Most couldn't stand it, which made it lots of fun. I discovered that I loved to have my feet tickled. I knew that if I didn't mind it no one would tickle my feet so I pretended that it was an excruciating experience. I read somewhere that in China one of the methods of torture was to hold people down and tickle the bottom of their feet with feathers. Someday I must travel to China and get tortured. So now you guys know how I discovered the pleasures of feet tickling. I think I was in about the fourth grade because of getting a late start in school. The school was racially rather mixed with a high percentage of black students. We called them colored in those days. I didn't have much trouble making friends with the boys and girls of the other races and got along just fine. My grades were just so-so along with the others which may have helped too. I also was involved with team sports, which helped. Before the beginning of the next school year Mother and Daddy said that they were enrolling Barbara and me in a boarding school in Canada, just about a one or two hour drive from Windsor. It was Saint Mary's Academy, a French Canadian Catholic boarding school. It was out in the country so I'm not sure of the nearest town or community. I seem to remember that it was in the vicinity of a town named Sandwich, Ontario. Although we didn't realize it at the time, at least I didn't, we were put in the Canadian school to be out of reach of the courts during Mother and Daddy's divorce proceedings and to protect us from any legal battles. To this day I don't know any of the details and don't care to. Both visited us at different times at Saint Mary's so I didn't really lose touch or respect for either one of them at that time or during the following many years. We were awarded to Mother's custody but were, as far as I know, free to visit Daddy any time we wished and we often did Saint Mary's was quite an educational experience. The boys and the girls were kept entirely separated and we wore navy blue uniforms most of the time. I had one advantage in that I could occasionally visit Barbara. Through her I got acquainted with several of the other neat girls, although under some degree of supervision from the Nuns. I was one of maybe three or four Protestant boys among mostly French Canadian Catholic and mostly bilingual boys. Another Protestant boy named Frank Newberry, also from Detroit, and I became close friends. To our sometimes embarrassment and chagrin we became favorites of some of the Sisters (Nuns). Perhaps, in part, it was an attempt to convert us, but not openly, and in part it was because academically Frank and I always stood number one and two in class standing. We just kind of alternated. Unlike the Detroit schools I attended, high academic standing at Saint Mary's conferred prestige and respect. For a fifth grader our studies included, among others, Canadian History and Geography, French, Math, Literature, Social Studies and, of course, Bible Studies. Each night after supper and before bedtime we had an hour or two of supervised study. It was really interesting and challenging. Being Protestant I wasn't required to get up and go to Chapel in the mornings before breakfast like most of the other boys. Frank and I decided to go anyway, both for the educations and to keep on the good side of the other guys. Consequently I bought a Rosary and could say my beads along with the best. I also joined the boy's choir. We had a great playground and played a lot of baseball and soccer. For some reason one of the other boys and I frequently tangled and kind of got into fights. Of course he had to go to confession and I didn't. One day I asked him what Father (the Priest) said to him when he confessed about our fights. He replied that Father advised him against getting into fights but always was interested in who won. It seems that the greater sin was losing. Our music teacher was Sister Cecilia. If she hadn't been a Nun she could have been a champion lady wrestler. Boy was she built. She had a deep voice and a great sense of humor. Whenever she told a funny story or joke she'd laugh and kind of shake the rafters. We all loved her. I forgot how I got my wooden flute or who gave it to me but Sister Cecilia taught me how to play it. She wrote and produced a musical play that included band formations. I was the lead with my real flute while all the other kids played kazoos. I remember getting into an argument with one of the other boys. Sister Cecilia simply picked the two of us up by the scuff until our toes barely touched the floor and held us nose to nose while she lectured us. I thought she was going to bang our heads together. Then, while we two boys grinned at each other she set us down and gave us both a pat on the head. We always looked forward to visitation days, when parents came to school. These days were very special. I got real lonely at times and wished I could get back to a normal home life. Sometime I'd cry a bit. One time Mother brought a gentleman friend of hers along to visit us. His name was Stanley Griebel. I don't know what his profession was but he could really tickle the piano ivories and was quite entertaining. I didn't express an opinion of him either way to Mother but Barbara developed a distrust, if not a dislike, of him. Later Mother discovered that he was an already married man so that ended that. Mother did a lot of travelling after her divorce and sent us postcards from some of the neat places she visited. One time she went to Lake Champlain and stayed at the Chateau Frontenac. Since she enjoyed golf she took her clubs with her. One night, in the hotel hallway, there was a terrible commotion and rowdyism. Mother sat up in bed much of the night with her driver held high, ready to clobber whoever entered her room. The next morning she complained and the hotel owner apologized profusely. He explained that this was a reunion of a group of priests who graduated from the same seminary as he did. It seems that they were letting their hair down a bit and bowling tenpins in the hallway, probably after some imbibing. Mother was an excellent cook and could prepare the same food many different ways. Whenever she experienced a new dish during her travels she'd somehow talk her way into the chef's kitchen and many times come away with his recipe. Maybe she exchanged some of her own in return. She took one memorable trip with Dr. Max Pinner and his wife Behrna. Remember back in my narrative when Dr. Pinner was head of the TB sanitarium where I was a patient. Dr. Pinner had accepted the position to head the Desert Sanitarium in Tucson, Arizona. The three of them drove from Detroit to Tucson with many interesting visits on the way. One that I especially remember was receiving postcards from was the Cliff Dwellings at Mesa Verde, Colorado. It wasn't until two years ago that Lorraine and I finally visited Mesa Verde. While he was in Tucson Dr. Pinner wrote a book entitled \"When Doctors are Patients\". I have a copy in my library. After several months in Arizona, Mother returned to Detroit. Nothing much else happened, that I can remember, until the end of the school year at St. Mary's when Mother said we were coming back to Detroit to live with her. As I recall it was back to the same apartment and to old friends Bob and Junie Vibbert. It was great to get back but school wasn't nearly as interesting or challenging. I guess I got kind of bored and maybe a little lazy because my grades again became mediocre. During that time I got and after school job of selling Saturday Evening Post subscriptions to people in the neighborhood. I'd take along sample copies and show people some of the interesting articles and stories mysteries especially. Mary Roberts Rinehart was a leading mystery author of that day and her stories helped me sell quite a few subscriptions and I met a lot of interesting people in the process. I suppose, with some support from Daddy and her own jobs Mother was able to support us. For a while she worked at Shean's, one of Detroit's leading bookstores. There she met many authors of that day who were there to promote their books and she collected a lot of signed first editions for her own library. Later she got a much better paying job at J.L. Hudson, the leading department store in Detroit, as head buyer of women's wear. One day Mother had gotten off an express bus from downtown when the driver closed the door and trapped a ring on her finger in the door. He dragged her for almost a block before the other passengers were able to get him to stop. Mother's shoes were literally ground down almost to her feet. In a daze she stumbled to a friend's house and fainted on the friend's front porch. Late she got hold of the bus company but they said that the driver had quit. She couldn't locate any witnesses so dropped the matter. Mother was an excellent driver. One day she was driving a friend's sport coupe when some gal came through a stop sign and hit her. The investigating officer wrote it up and since the car was still driveable Mother proceeded on her way. One block later a left turning car broadsided her. Same investigating officer. He hauled her in saying that anyone who could have two accidents in two blocks had to be drinking. Of course she hadn't. Mother asked the Desk Sergeant if she could call a friend who was a judge. He said \"Sure lady but it won[t do you any good\" ' She talked to the Judge and then handed the phone to the sergeant. The sergeant rather unhappily released Mother immediately. It was the better part of a year before Mother brought someone else to meet Barbara and me. She had met him through a mutual friend. His name was Arthur Holt. I thought he seemed just right for Mother and liked him a lot. I think Barbara felt the same way. It wasn't long after that Mother asked us how we felt about her marrying Mr. Holt. We said \"great\". Then came the question about what we would call him. We already had a Daddy and we felt that \"Mr. Holt\" was too formal and \"Arthur\" wasn't appropriate so Barbara and I decided that \"Dad\" would be just right. I was 12 and Barbara 11. Dad had not been married before but was a much sought after bachelor of 30 some years. He and two other bachelors, Glen Edelman and Chick (I don't remember his last name) shared a fancy apartment. Dad had a Buick that they said was so big that it had to be backed up twice to turn a corner. Glen had a new LaSalle and a neat lake cottage that we later visited often. Such were the trappings of bachelorhood. Dad was state agent for all of Michigan, except Detroit, for the Aetna fire Insurance Company. As such he called on agents all over the state and had to approve insurance claims, etc. As an engagement present Dad gave Mother a new 1932 Ford V8 sport coupe. This was the first new model after the Model A was discontinued. Mother's car was blue with black fenders and yellow wire wheels with spare tires mounted on each of the two front fenders. At the same time Dad got rid of the Buick and got himself a new Ford sedan which was furnished by Aetna. Also he bought a new brick two-story house on Edinborough Road just north of Six Mile road in Detroit. This was just outside of Rosedale Park where I used to go to grade school and many of my old friends still lived. There were only two houses on our four block long, dead end street. There also were many vacant lots and some sand dunes nearby for us kids to play on. In preparation for their marriage and honeymoon Mother and Dad rented a cottage on Lake Orion about an hour drive from Detroit. Grandma Taphouse came down from Minnesota to take care of Barbara and me at the cottage during the summer while Mother and Dad were off honeymooning. Quite a summer it was for all. The name of our cottage was Squirrel Chase. It came with a dock and a rowboat. All of the nearby cottages had quaint names such as Dunker Inn. A widow, who we knew as Culley, lived nearby and owned a white canoe which I admired. She kind of took a liking to me so told me I could use her canoe anytime I wished that was after she was satisfied that I could swim pretty well. I remember the first time I paddled it out onto the lake alone. There was a slight breeze from shore. I sat in the back of the canoe and paddled out a ways. When I tried to turn around and come back to shore the wind would catch the bow and turn me back away from shore. I was scared but decided to paddle backwards to get ashore. Later Culley told me about how to get in the middle of the canoe in a situation like that. The rowboat was lots of fun too. I got two poles and lashed them upright, one on each side of the boat, and fastened a blanket between the two to make a square-rigged sail. The only trouble was that I always had to remove the blanket and row the boat to get back to the dock. I built a little raft out of old lumber. I tied a line from it to the stern of the rowboat and asked Barbara to get on it to test it out while I towed the raft away from the dock. Once she was on it I kept going and towed it out to the middle of the lake and cast off the line and rowed away leaving her stranded. With her weight on it the raft was barely afloat and Barbara could hardly move for fear of capsizing. I did keep her in sight and finally went back and \"rescued\" her. Lake Orion was really three lakes connected together by waterways. The town of Lake Orion was at the end of an adjoining arm of the lake next to us. Since we didn't have a car it was my job to row Grandma into town to do the grocery and other shopping. It was really neat but sure a long several miles of rowing. Grandma was a great cook and baker. She made our own bread and cinnamon rolls. I vividly remember how she would place trays of bread and rolls on the bed so the dough could rise without being disturbed by vibration from people walking about. One day I guess I spent too much time in the sun and got pretty badly sunburned, especially on my arms. In a few days they began to blister. While walking along a path next to a hill of cinders, I stumbled and rolled down the hill. Talk about pain and discomfort. Grandma spent quite a bit of time picking out tiny cinders from my arm and sterilizing the wounds. Fortunately I wasn't left with any scars. Another activity was riding a neighbor's horses. It was the first time I had been up on a horse and the horse seemed to know it. I never could get used to the horse putting its head down and me looking off into space from that lofty perch. That's when I decided that riding horses just wasn't my cup of tea although I like horses. There just seemed to be more efficient ways to get about. After a blissful summer of fun and, perhaps much to Grandma's relief, Mother and Dad returned from their honeymoon. They had traveled by car to Canada and the New England states, especially Hartford, Connecticut where Aetna's home office was located and many of Dad's friends. The new Ford they drove cracked a block but Ford replaced the engine, no charge. We moved into our new house and began life as a family. Dad adjusted very well to family life with two half-grown kids. In fact he seemed to be busting a few buttons at times. Mother and Dad also developed a rather busy social life and did lots of entertaining since Mother had so many friends in Rosedale Park added to Dad's many friends in other parts of Detroit. A person who made life easier for all of us was Irene, our full time maid, cook and handy gal. She was from Poland, as were many girls in those days that came over to this country and got jobs as domestic helpers. (see picture of mother and Irene). As for me, it was back to my old Cooke School and friends. Since we were at the edge of Rosedale Park, kind of in the country, I developed a hankering for another dog. One day a stray German Shepherd (sometimes called a Police dog) kind of adopted me and I talked Irene out of some yummy scraps to feed him. I called him Pal. He didn't have a collar or identification. Unknown to me Dad had already gotten a dog for me that was still at the vet's getting shots and checked over. Fortunately Pal and I hadn't developed a close attachment yet so somewhat reluctantly I gave Pal to a neighbor boy named Bud Bentley, who lived in a house across the fields. Dad then brought home a cute little grey and white ball of fur, which didn't have a tail and had long bangs of hair flopping down over its eyes. It was a pure bred Old English Sheep Dog puppy. What to name him? At the time I had been reading a book that really caught my imagination and at times reduced me to tears. In fact at night, after I was supposed to be asleep, I continued to read the book under the covers with a flashlight. It was about a horse. The name of the book and the horse was Smokey by Will James. So there was just one name that seemed to fit that puppy, Smokey it was and Smokey he became. Smokey and I did a lot of exploring along with Bud Bentley and Pal. One thing I did discover was how Smokey seemed prone to pick up cockleburs and sometimes manure in his long shaggy coat. It was quite a job picking out and sometimes having to cut out burrs. As for the manure, one time we were close to a stream so I picked Smokey up and tossed him into the stream. The purpose was to neutralize the manure and to find out how well he could swim. He paddled ashore okay but much of the manure stayed so I had to Laundry-tub him when we got home. I also had to launder myself. By the way, when Smokey got wet he became half his normal size in appearance. I guess we guys were often hungry so we spent much of our time hanging around Irene's kitchen begging handouts which she often bestowed upon us. Boy could she cook!!! There was only one other house on our four block-long paved street so it was great for a lot of street activities. I think we may have been the inventors of several new sports. One was roller skate hockey and the other was bicycle polo using croquet balls and mallets. Both sometimes created painful spills and lacerations since we didn't have protective clothing. Also more than one croquet mallet got \"accidentally\" stuck in the spokes of an opponent's bicycle which helped us develop a knowledge of and skill for bicycle repair. Another activity was model airplane building. I had a place, both in the garage and in the basement, where I could work on the models. One of my favorites was a rubber band powered flying model of the Curtis Robin. It was a cabin model airplane made out of balsa wood and Japanese tissue (rice paper). I made several sizes of the plane by scaling up the plans with visions of someday scaling it up to a size I could ride in and fly. During the summer, the light was better in the garage so I built the models there. The trouble was that we also had sparrows that often pooped on my airplanes. I guess they were either disrespectful or envious. From then on, I sat at the bench with my BB gun across my lap and zapped a few of them, which helped solve that problem. I figured that the ones I missed would spread the word for the others to stay away. I also made real true-to-scale models. One that I worked on for several years was a Curtis Condor passenger biplane. It even had cabin lights and swinging cabin doors as well as cockpit controls that operated the ailerons, elevators and rudder. I hadn't completed the plane before Marcia, my little half sister, got hold of it and played with it one day. That was all for that model which ended up in ruins. And that reminds me. Marcia showed up to bless our household on October 24, 1933. I was 13 years old then. I remember Irene giving Marcia her bath in a bathinette and what fun it was to held her and talk to her. All she could say was \"Umm Laa Laa\". She and I had some pretty sophisticated two-word philosophical discussions. Barbara and I were old enough that Marcia kind of grew up in an all-adult household but certainly didn't suffer for a lack of attention. Mother said one time that she named Marcia \"Marcia\" because she enjoyed hearing a good friend of hers, Marge Wood, pronounc it \"Moorsha\". Marge originally came from Philadelphia, accent and all. Back to our outdoor activities. My bicycle became indispensable as my means of transportation to school, for delivering papers and for exploring. Bud and I learned about a cider mill a few miles out in the country where one could sample as much cider as he could drink on the spot for just a few cents. Of course the idea was to sell gallon bottles of the cider. We strapped a hot water bottle under our shirts and rode our bicycles out to do a little sampling. We couldn't sneak too much cider into the bottles because of obvious bulging. I kind of think the owner knew what we were doing but let us get away with a little extra hoping we'd bring our parents back. We sometimes did. I got a job delivering the evening edition of the Detroit Free Press newspaper. Although I had some regular customers I also hawked many of the papers as I rode up and down the streets on my bike hollering \"Detroit Free Press-read all about it\" and calling out the headline. People who wished a paper either turned on their porch lights or came out into the front yard. I picked up quite a few new customers that way. On the outskirts of nearby Redford was a park where they had a swimming pool, tennis courts, etc. Nearby was an automobile rollercoaster made of wooden planking. When it was open, people could drive their cars up and down the steep hills and leaning curves. We used to play tennis for a while, then take a nice shower, swim and then another shower. Afterwards, one day, we decided to ride our bikes on the rollercoaster even thought it was closed with gates at both ends. I was coming down the last steep hill at a pretty good clip when I decided to apply my coaster brakes before reaching the closed gate at the bottom. Something went wrong, like my chain coming off the sprocket, because the pedals turned backward but no brakes. Since there were rails on both sides I couldn't drive over the side. Because of the wooden planks and splinters I didn't want to dump the bike and slide down on my rumpus so I decided to hit the gate and go sailing over it. Fortunately the road at the end was mostly dirt so I ended up turning a somersault and landing in the dirt. However, the front wheel of the bike was an oval and the fork was bent back so it needed a whole new front end. It sure was a long walk home. I had to borrow a bike for the paper route for a while. There was a girl in the neighborhood that palled around with us on occasion. One day we were riding our bikes when I kind of teasingly ran her over to the curb. She laid down her bike, walked over to me and before I knew what she had in mind she gave me a right hook that landed me off the bike and onto the pavement. That was the last time I fooled around with her. Also I'll never forget the time I was pedaling down the street alone at a pretty good clip when I ran into a swarm of gnats. Most of them seemed to go into my open front shirt. I didn't even wait for the bike to stop before I bailed off and stripped away my shirt and started swatting and brushing away the horde. Even had them in my eyes and mouth. Sputooey!! In those days, in Detroit, at 14 years old we were allowed to get learner's driver permits. Since our dead-end street was ideal to practice on, Mother came along as I practiced shifting, turning and driving her car. They didn't have automatic transmissions in those days and the gearshift was on the floor alongside the hand brake lever. After I got pretty proficient she'd let me practice alone, only on our street though I know she shouldn't have. Then she and Dad let me drive in traffic sometimes when they were along. Our driveway was single lane beside the house and then broadened to two cars wide behind the house before leading to our Two-car garage. The garage doors were hinged on the sides of each opening so each half door opened outward. One day Dad's care was parked in the driveway beside the house and Mother's was in the garage. Both Mother and Dad had been picked up by friends so weren't at home. I had the keys only to Mother's car, which was blocked by Dad's. So I got Irene to help me push Dad's car toward the garage to make room for me to get Mother's out. The driveway sloped slightly downhill toward the garage so when we got the car rolling I jumped in on the passenger side to apply the brakes. I stuck my foot over to step on the foot brake but in the process jammed my leg between the gearshift and the hand brake lever. Consequently I couldn't pull on the hand brake either. So I sat there while the car went sailing through the closed doors on Dad's side of the Garage. When Dad got home, I tried to explain the sequence of events. His only reaction was \"Well let's get the tools and see if we can put the doors back together and onto their hinges\" ' We did. I'll never forget my first practical lesson about the speed of electricity. In those early days of refrigeration the refrigerator was located in the kitchen but the belt driven compressor was located in the basement. An electric motor drove the compressor. It was my job to keep the basement cleaned. One day I decided to hose down the concrete basement floor. Somehow I turned the spray onto the compressor motor while it was running and the electricity ran up the water spray to the nozzle and through me to the wet basement floor and on to the metal drain. I recoiled which diverted the spray away from the motor and broke the circuit. That's when I decided not to become an Electrical Engineer. Dad spent quite a bit of time on the road traveling throughout Michigan on business. In fact he often went into the office on Monday and then traveled from Tuesday through Friday. Once in a while he took me along. I remember one memorable trip we took to northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. It was beautiful country. We visited such places as Houghton and Hancock and saw a lot of copper mines where Dad's company carried the insurance. We also saw lots of deer. In fact one of Detroit's favorite sports, during deer season, was to see who would be back to Detroit first with a buck lashed to the roof of his car or over the fender. I forgot the reason, but about that time, my folks decided to sell our house and purchase another one. It was inside Rosedale Rosedale Park, south of 6 Mile Road but also on Edinborough Road. It was more convenient for me because of being closer to school and many of my friends. The new house was one and one half stories high and stucco construction. I remember that it had a nice studio living room one step down from the rest of the first floor The floor was inlaid with bare wood with a high gloss varnish. We had a studio couch up against the wall with pillows leaning against the wall. I can't count the times when I plopped down on the couch only to have it go sailing out from under me as I landed on the floor behind it. It was about then that I entered Redford High School. About half of my Cooke School classmates decided to go to Cooley High which had the unbelievable student body of 10,000. Many of us preferred the smaller but, I thought, more friendly and personalized atmosphere of Redford High. Among my favorite subjects were Latin, Math and Mechanical Drawing. Apparently I had enough talent in drawing that my instructor suggested later that I apply for a scholarship and admission to the prestigious General Motors Trade School I didn't go out for sports in high school but sure attended all of the games and rooted for the home team. One of our rivals was Hamtramack High in Hamtramack, a suburb of Detroit. It's the largest Polish community in the country. Invariably we'd get creamed by those big Polish guys who we accused of being 24-year-old high school seniors. Forrest Evashevski, the one time football coach at Iowa University was a Hantramack alumnus. When I turned 16 I got my own driver's license. To get the license we were required to take a high school driver training and evaluation course. Our high school was selected by Aetna Life Insurance Company and General Motors as the research school to test a Driver's Education Course before being introduced to the rest of the schools in the nation. Aetna furnished the testing machines for color blindness, depth-of-perception, reaction timing and many other physical tests. General Motors furnished the driver training cars and textbooks. All students were required to take the course, which was an intensive full semester. We had to learn all about the construction of a car, how the engine, clutch, transmission, differential, etc. worked. We also were taught passing distance calculations, inertia and cornering, driving on ice, etc. It was pretty intensive stuff, which the girls had to take too. We also visited Ford and GM assembly plants. In those days, 1936, each make of car had its own distinctive radiator, hood and lines. When the new model year arrived the cars were shipped to the showrooms all draped with canvas covers so no one could see them before the grand openings. However we learned to recognize the makes just by the shape of the canvas. Each company had its own slogan like \"When better cars are built, Buick will build them\" or for the Plymouth Terraplane \"In the air it's aeroplane, on water it's hydroplane and on land it's TERRAPLANE\". I think it was Buick, which had the slogan \"Ask the man who owns one\". Those were the days of such cars as the Jordan, Hupmobile, LaSalle and Packard, all of which have passed into history. My drive's license opened up a whole new world for me. That summer I landed a job delivering milk for a man named Smith who lived in Rosedale Park. He had to retire, because of health, from an executive position in a large dairy. His doctor advised that he get a job which would get him outdoors and some good exercise. So he decided to operate milk delivery routes from his home and called the business Smith Dairy. It consisted of two milk trucks and routes in North and South Rosedale Parks. His milk was supplied by the Farmington Dairy in Farmington, Michigan. He needed someone to drive the second truck and make deliveries. I applied and got the job delivering milk in North Rosedale Park. The route was an afternoon one from about 1 PM to 4 PM, three days each week. I got paid $7 per week, which I thought was great money. The best part was that I already knew most of my customers. Each day I'd transfer from Mr. Smith's truck to my truck, milk, juices, butter, eggs, buttermilk and ice cream. During the summer I had to pack blocks of ice in with the dairy products. None of the milk was homogenized in those days and all came in quart, pint and half-pint glass bottles with cardboard caps on top. Invariably the cream rose to the top of the milk bottles. In the winter, if it froze, the milk caps rose two to three inches above the top of the bottle on a column of cream. Most of my customers had Servidors into which I could place the milk. A Servidor was a large metal box built into the side of the house, generally located next to the side entrance door. A cast iron outer door had an interlock so that it could be opened, only if the inside door was closed and locked. The inside door could only be opened if the outside door was closed. This provided security. On arriving at a house I either already knew what items the customer wanted and what days of the week they were wanted or the customer left a card or note in the box with instructions. In several cases I had to deliver more than the Servidor would hold so was instructed to come into the kitchen and place the order in the icebox or refrigerator. This was the case with the Dunn's who had seven kids, including one my age who was a good friend. Sometimes workmen, building a new house, would call to me for buttermilk or ice cream. It was also my responsibility to make up bills for my customers and leave them in their Servidor boxes. I also had to collect on delinquent payments due. One time, a past due customer who was an optometrist, offered to give me a free eye exam in lieu of payment. I wouldn't have touched that with a twenty-foot pole. Each afternoon, when I returned from my route, I had to balance out my books and inventory to the penny. One of my classmates in high school was Helen McAfee. She was a real Scottish lass and one with lots of style and bearing. I did not know her well. However, one day, while I was delivering milk she and her mother were driving by and stopped to invite me for a little outing on their boat which they kept at the Detroit Yacht Club on Belle Isle in the Detroit River. I said \"yes\" The next weekend her dad, mother and she picked me up at home and we drove out to Belle Isle and the yacht harbor. Their boat was big enough for three or four couples to dance in the main cabin. Later, on several occasions, we did just that. They took the boat out onto Lake Saint Clair, where we spent the day sunning, swimming and visiting. I remember diving off one side of the boat and swimming under it to the other side when we were playing tag. It was kind of scary under there and looking up at the keel. Helen became a good friend during the remainder of my high school days, though I only dated her on occasion. In fact I was so busy with the milk route and school-work that I didn't do much dating during that time. While we're talking about boats, I think the most boating enjoyment I had was later working on the 55 foot Ketch which belonged to Arne Moe, an Aetna associate of Dad's. Arne headed the Inland Marine Division of Aetna for Michigan. He designed his boat and had it built to his specifications and kept it at the Detroit Yacht Club. I spent time as a deck hand doing mundane things like polishing the brass and chrome and swabbing down the decks. Sometime I got to go along on short day cruises. One of the big boating events on the Detroit River was the running of the Harmsworth Trophy races. This was the international granddaddy of boat racing. I remember seeing Gar Wood break the 100 mile-per-hour speed barrier and setting a new world record with one of his Miss America boats powered by six Packard marine engines. Later he was challenged, at different times, to race against Kaye Don and Betty Carstairs, both from Great Brittain. Gar Wood retained his title in both races. At the speed those boats traveled they had to clear every floating stick from the river. The smallest debris could rip a hull wide open. Oh yes, both challengers were at a disadvantage since they were used to racing in more dense salt water where the boats ran higher in the water than in the fresh water of the Detroit River. At that time, somewhere around 1936 or 1937, Detroit was known as the City of Champions. In addition to Gar Wood's speed boat title, we had the champion Detroit Tigers in baseball, the Red Wings in ice hockey, the Lions in pro football and Joe Lewis in boxing, all in the same year and at the same time. It was an exciting sports place to live. Now back to high school. Many of the guys I ran around with and got involved in sports with were sons of close friends of Mother and Dad. Don and Art Robinson were sons of Dud (a dentist) and Lena Robinson. Dr. Robinson was and active University of Michigan alumnus and sports supporter of the University of Michigan. Don went on to play football for Michigan. I remember the times when we drove to Ann Arbor to attend games and sat in the bleachers, covered with snow and whipped by ice cold winds. We were wrapped up in blankets trying to enjoy the game. Both Don and Art were good sandlot hockey players and we spent many hours on the neighborhood rink in Rosedale Park. Then there was Bud Maynard (son of Horace and Bea Maynard. I remember the story about Mr. Maynard, who was secretary to the Fisher brothers, saying that Pontiac couldn't build a kiddie car that year. Word got around so his year-end bonus included a new Pontiac. Al Rogers, another friend of mine, came home one day and raided his refrigerator for a bite to eat. He didn't know that their maid had put an unfinished half can of dog food in a bowl in the refrigerator which he unknowingly wolfed down. Others I palled around with were Ed Dunn and Jack Duff and several more whose names I can't recall. Both Jack and I were serious stamp collectors. We also played chess. Rather than trade stamps, he and I would select the stamp we wanted most from the other's collection and put it the pot. Then the winner of the chess game got both stamps in the pot. One winter day we were all out just messing around when one of the guys threw a couple of snowballs at the front door of a house owned by some crabby lady. She saw us and knowing who we were called each of our parents. Everyone of the fellow was grounded except me. The reason was that she didn't know that Mother and Dad's name was different than mine and couldn't find mine in the phone book. I went around visiting my grounded buddies until word got back to Mother, at which time I also became a groundee. Another friend of my folks was Ed Stone and his wife, whose name I don't remember. He was an executive with the bus division of General Motors. They had a daughter my age named Carol Ann. Ed was one of the founders of the Greyhound Bus Lines which originated in Hibbing, Minnesota. I understand the he and one of the other founders picked the name. About a year after we moved back into Rosedale Park, Ed died of a heart attack. 1 was asked to drive one of the family cars in the funeral procession. It was a mile long Buick Limited. I never saw so many huge limousines and so much Detroit automotive brass in one place at the same time. The father of one of my classmates, Ruth Solar, was shop instructor for the high school. He also had a shop in his basement where he operated the Solar Craftsman's Guild and where he taught woodworking in the evening. I enrolled and built a ship's wheel lamp. One turned the wheel to turn the lamp on and off. Every piece had to be turned on the lathe or otherwise hand made, including the ship's wheel spokes. I don't know what ever happened to that lamp. By this time Marcia was becoming a real darling two or three year old toddler. The year was 1936. I vividly remember two events involving Marcia that shook us all up. One day the snippy little dog from next door came into our yard and bit Marcia on the nose. After getting Marcia patched up Mother asked the lady next door to have the dog examined for rabies. The lady got real nasty and refused to do so. Mother got the police or a court order to have the tests made. They turned out negative The lady never spoke to any of us again, which was kind of sad. Another time Marcia toddled across the street into the neighbor's driveway just as he was backing his car out. Dad happened to spot them and let out one blood-curdling yell. It startled the neighbor and he stopped to see what the trouble was. This probably saved Marcia's life. I used to love to read to Marcia and tell her stories and jokes. I've often wondered how much of what I said she really believed. One day Mother told me that the niece of her friend Marge Wood was visiting for the next month. She asked me if I would meet her and show her around. My reaction was \"Oh no, Mom, do I really have to?\" Finally I gave in and agreed to do it. So the next day Mother and I went over to the Wood's and I was introduced to their niece from Philadelphia, Jane Steele. She was a tall, very striking girl. All of a sudden I realized that this assignment, should I choose to accept it, wouldn't be bad at all. See the photograph of Jane. For the next four weeks I took Jane swimming, golfing, dancing, and all over the city of Detroit, including canoeing on Belle Isle. Since she was an avid Philadelphia Phillies baseball fan I also took her to some of the Detroit Tiger games to show her how a real baseball team played. We had a ball together. When it came time for her to return home, I also joined the Wood's in seeing her off at the train. Incidentally, flying wasn't yet the popular mode of transportation and couldn't compete with the luxury trains of the day, such as the Twentieth Century Limited. It didn't take me long to realize how much I missed Jane. However, keeping busy with the milk route and doing things with the guys got me back into the swing of things. By the way, during high school I was able to do the afternoon milk route since all of my classes were held in the morning. Jane and I exchanged letters at least once each week and this exchange continued until my second year in college at lowa State University. She also made several following visits to Detroit and I made one to Philadelphia over the years. We discovered that we were in love with each other. One day a friend, Eddie (can't recall his last name) and I conjured up a two week trip by auto to the upper peninsula of Northern Michigan. The problem was that we didn't have a car. I talked this over with Dad and he said he'd see what he could work out for us. In the meantime Mr. Smith said he could get a substitute for me if the trip worked out. The next day I came home from the milk route and there sat a brand new Chevy. A good friend of Mother and Dad's was Lloyd Ginn, who owned Ginn Chevrolet, the largest Chevy dealer in the US. Lloyd told Dad to let us take one of his demo cars. Eddie and I mainly camped along the way and had lots of interesting experiences. I particularly remember our visit to Mackinac Island, located in Lake Huron between St. Ignace on the Upper Peninsula and Mackinaw city on the lower state of Michigan. At that time there was no bridge across the strait. We had to take a ferry from Mackinaw City to St. Ignace. While in Mackinaw City we decided to go over to Mackinac Island. Cars aren't allowed on the Island. Because of rough water, the ferry to the island was cancelled that day. We wandered down to the marina at Mackinaw City and got to talking with a man who owned a little diesel powered whaleback boat. He was getting ready to go to the island and agreed to take us along. The boat was totally enclosed and I think could even float upside down. It seemed like we spent half the time under water as the waves came breaking over the top of the boat. What a ride. After reaching the island, Eddie rented a horse and I rented a bicycle and we decided to explore. The island is about nine miles around. Eddie rode ahead of me with me right behind - that is until his horse threw a shoe, which went sailing past my head. At that point I either took the lead or rode far behind. Besides, riding a bicycle behind a horse doesn't give one the most scenic views. It was a real fun trip. Now back to Detroit. Although I had to ask permission each time, Mother was very generous in letting me use her car. She did say that she couldn't understand how I often had enough gas to get into our driveway but then she didn't have enough gas to get back out of it. One day Dad came home from work to inform us that we were all moving to Iowa. He had been with Aetna in lowa previously and was being transferred back because of his knowledge of farm insurance. It was kind of funny because Mother had once said \"I'll go any where in the world with you, Art, except to Iowa\". It was somewhat of a disappointment to me because of high school friends and the fact that I had my heart set on enrolling at the University of Michigan after high school. But then we all accepted it and prepared ourselves for a new adventure. This reminds me of something else Mother told Dad before they were married. She said, \"Art, if I'm one day older than you I won't marry you\". It turned out that Dad was about six months older than Mother so everything was okay. Then many years later, after Dad died and Mother was checking into pensions, social security, etc., she discovered that she was a year older then she thought which made her six months older than Dad. Those were very precarious times for Marcia since she wouldn't be here if Mother had known. Back to the Iowa move. It wasn't scheduled until sometime in January, which allowed us to pursue our holiday season plans. At the time I was into my Junior year in high school. This was the fall of 1937. I also remember it as the year that the Hindenburg zeppelin went down in flames in Lakehurst, New Jersey. At that time I was occasionally dating a girl clear across town in Highland Park. Her name was Cecile Jones. I had invited Cecile to a big formal dance that was being held at the Rosedale Park Clubhouse. One week before the dance, Marge Wood told Mother that Jane was coming for about a two-week visit. I agonized and agonized about the dance and then decided that it would be unfair to break my date with Cecile. So Bud Maynard stepped in and took Jane. All my \"friends\" booked up every dance with Jane and even froze me out on the one or two cut dances. I tried to show Cecile a good time buy was sure miserable inside. Then I asked Jane to a high school basketball game. The guys even beat me to that. During the two weeks Jane and I did get together much of the time and later laughed about how the fellows outmaneuvered me. I didn't think it was so funny at the time. After the Christmas and New Year festivities, our attention turned to packing and getting ready for the big move to Des Moines. Dad had already purchased a house in Des Moines. It was located on Waterbury Circle so things were prepared at that end. It was sometime in January when the moving van was loaded. The second to the last thing into the van was Smokey's dog house and the last thing was Smokey himself. During the trip the moving fellows walked, watered and fed Smokey and became quite attached to him. During the trip, Dad drove his car with Barbara along and I drove Mother's car with she and Marcia along with me. Each evening we were to meet and rendezvous at a particular hotel. The first day out, evening was approaching and we yet had 100 miles to go. Mother, Marcia and I stopped for supper and then started out again. It was dusk when a terrible blizzard hit. I couldn't see the road so we turned around and went back to the hotel where we had had supper. We had no idea where Dad and Barbara were. They had made it to our destination but we holed up where we were. Lines were down so we couldn't let Dad know. I guess he had a bad time wondering about us too. Next morning we got through to him and we made it behind some snowplows. To help pass the miles away we all did a lot of singing and enjoyed the Burma Shave signs along the road. I remember some of them quite well. For example: NO LADY LIKES TO DANCE OR DINE WHEN SHE'S OUT WITH A PORCUPINE Burma Shave I included two other examples in my REMEMBRANCES. The next stop was Chicago and a visit with Grandma and Granpa Holt and Aunt Mildred and Aunt Gertrude. They actually lived in Evanston, a suburb on the north side of Chicago. We kind of had a second Christmas. While there we stayed at Uncle Rob's big home in Evanston. Uncle Rob Holt, a lawyer, was one of Dad's uncles. That's where your brother Rob got his nickname. Another uncle, Harley Holt, was a minister. Dad's father, Alfred Eugene Hold, was also a lawyer. His mother, Grace Pacific Knowles Holt, was the daughter of Captain Knowles, who commanded an old Clipper trading ship. She was born on the Pacific ocean and as a child was worldly traveled. Dad also had two sisters, Mildred and Gertrude and one brother who I never met. See pictures. That's about it for this year. I'll try to get back to you about Des Moines before another year has passed. Love to all!! Dad The time is early January 1937 still enroute to Iowa Well here we are starting the third chapter of this narrative. If we don't get going we'll never finish our move to Des Moines. When we left Chicago it was a one-day, 300 plus mile trip to Des Moines. I remember the thrill of anticipation as we crossed the Mississippi River on Highway 30 and entered Iowa. Most of the roads were new since Iowa hadn't really started its road construction program until the middle 30's. There was only one problem - the roads seemed awfully narrow. Iowa had decided to build a slight upward curve or curb on the outer edges of the highway to help contain water for drainage to the bottom of each grade. Then they painted a double centerline on the theory that it would keep the traffic heading in each direction better separated. The trouble was that the curb and double centerline used up too much of the road width leaving less room for cars and trucks. Also the curb was dangerous because people would get their right wheels up on it and then over-steer trying to get back on the roadway. I got used to it but remained very careful to stay between the yellow line and curb. The first thing that struck me were the hills and rolling countryside since I'd imagined lowa as being flat as a billiard table with nothing but corn growing on it. There was an awful lot of corn and I couldn't imagine how people could eat it all. The Mother told me that they fed most of it to livestock. That struck me as being awfully wasteful until I learned the difference between sweet corn and cattle-feed corn. I guess there is also corn for Liquor. Anyway there was lots of it. Waterbury Circle was, and still is, located on the west end of town near the city limits between Des Moines and what was then the little town of Valley Junction, now West Des Moines. Waterbury Circle was the Crème de la Crème of street addresses. As the name implies it was just one big circle. Ours was a big, white, two-story house with 56 windows. I know because I changed the screens and storm windows twice each year. The house was on a corner of one of the two streets that joined the circle with the rest of the world. The trolley line, which ran from downtown Des Moines to Valley Junction ran along Ingersol Street, right behind our house. We stayed at a hotel the first night, until the moving van arrived the next day. The first thing out of the van was Smokey and the next was his dog house. Boy, were we glad to see him. The only trouble was that when the van was unloaded and ready to leave, Smokey hopped aboard thinking that we were all off to a further destination. Finally he got the idea that this was our new home. Barbara, Marcia and I each had our own bedrooms and spent the first few days getting settled into them and helping Mother and Dad unload, unpack and shelve all of the thousands of item involved in such a move. Since it wad early January, Barbara and I had to think about and enroll in high school. I was in the second half of 11™ grade and Barbara was at the end of 10th grade or first half of 11th \", I don't remember which. Our new school was Roosevelt High, named after Teddy Roosevelt, and our teams were nicknamed the \"Roughriders\" - what else. Enrollment was some 2,000 plus. Although we didn't realize it at the time, Roosevelt was looked upon by high schools in the rest of the city and state as an uppity, spoiled, wealthy kid's school. I thought it was pretty neat and it felt like a little town little high school compared to Detroit. In fact it gave me a lot of self-confidence to excel and become and active participant in school activities. I was assigned to a second floor homeroom #235 and became somewhat the center of attention as the new kid on the block. There were some real nice and interesting students in the homeroom like Gaylord Gray, Bob Huck, Laura Jane Webbles, Mary Drennen and Mildred Thompson. Since we didn't have seat assignments in the homeroom we could sit wherever we wished-first come first served. I didn't realize it at the time but on the third day I sat in the seat that the class bully thought belonged to him. He came into class a little late and insisted that I move. I refused. He grabbed the chair but I sat there grabbing it by one hand and the table by the other and simply said \"no way\". The ruckus drew everyone's attention and he finally moved on to an empty chair. I heard some gasps so I must have done something unusual. After that, many of my classmates made a point of introducing themselves and visiting with me. It's pretty difficult to enter a new high school in the mid junior year and get involved in activities which the others have been pursuing since their freshman year. I did go out for track and swimming, since I was too light for the contact sports. I also joined the staff of the WEEKLY ROUNDUP which was our student newspaper and made the debate team, all of which brought me in contact with a lot of the other students. In fact both Barbara and I were on the ROUNDUP staff and debate team. Six months later Betty Benson wrote in my 1938 yearbook \"Graydon—If you are always able to fit in with a group and make an impression as you have on us this year, you won't have to worry. But just the same - I want to wish you a profusion of happiness and good luck!\" That was one of the nicest compliments I've received. In the meantime Mother and Dad enrolled Marcia in one of the elementary schools nearby our house. I remember hearing Mother tell about the principal of Marcia's school coming up to Dad and throwing her arms around him with a great big \"Hello Art, it's good to see you again\". You see, Dad was a bachelor in Des Moines before moving to Detroit where he met Mother. Apparently the principal was a gal he dated or was a good friend from those early days. Small world! After Detroit, Des Moines seemed like a lot further distance from Philadelphia (Narberth, PA) and Jane and in fact it was twice as far. Jane and I exchanged letters at least once each week and I started to figure out ways I could earn enough money to travel to Philadelphia for a visit with her. She and I agreed that because of the distances involved and the fact that we couldn't see each other more than every year or two, both of us would be free to date and pursue our normal social activities. In fact we felt that it would both test and strengthen our relationship. Since there were lots of big yards and lawns in our Des Moines neighborhood, I developed a clientele for lawn mowing and fall leaf raking. These jobs helped me to meet my expenses and save some extra for a trip east. There was a DX gas station about two blocks from our house. I got a job there pumping gas after school and in the evenings. The station was located at the foot of a long steep hill at the corner of Grand Avenue and Ingersoll. In the wintertime cars would often get stuck going up the hill or slide out of control going down. We had a good view of these emergencies and automatically jumped into the tow truck/wrecker and went to the rescue. It was a handy way to make some extra bucks. One evening a man broke a rear axle on his car. Another student and I were working the station that afternoon and evening so we towed the car in and, on the spur of the moment, offered to replace his axle. We'd never done anything like this before but decided to give it a go. After figuring out how to remove the broken one we got replacement parts from the Metz Auto Supply house downtown. We closed up the station early and then it took us all night of fittin' and tryin' to install the new axle. Finally we got the job done about daybreak. What a night! We decided not to go into the car repair business after that experience. Which reminds me -- Helen Metz was the only daughter of Mr. Metz, who owned the auto parts business I just referred to. She was a striking girl and overly protected by her parents, at least as far as boys were concerned. Helen was working with me in the preparation for a debate. One evening, after supper, I suggested that we go down to the public library to do some research. She asked her dad, and to my amazement he said OK. So I guess I had somehow earned his trust, maybe when we fixed the axle. After graduation Helen went to the exclusive Mills College somewhere on the west coast. I later heard that she really let down her hair out there after being released from strict parental custody. At Roosevelt High and in our neighborhood, I gradually accumulated a circle of friends both fellows and girls that I palled around with. One of my favorite activities was playing golf on our nearby Waveland golf course. It was an interesting and hilly 18 hole course which I played at least once each week and sometimes two or three time in a week. I got my score down into the high eighties and low nineties. A fellow, whose name I can't seem to recall, and I decided one day to try a new course out on Merle Hay Road near Fort Dodge. We hopped on his motorcycle, clubs and all, and headed out of town. We were cruising along when my clubs somehow got tangled in the motorcycle works and sent us out of control down the grass lined ditch alongside the road. Balls, broken clubs, the motorcycle and we went sliding along for what seemed like an eternity. Neither of us was more than badly shaken up. We abandoned the golf plans and limped back to Des Moines. That was the last time I've ridden a motorcycle. Charlie Schleichter and I developed a common interest in short wave radio. After some reading up and experimentation we managed to build a couple of battery operated combination radio transmitters and receivers called transceivers. Since they were supper short wave, 1 ¼ meters, they didn't have much range but that was alright with us since neither of us had the required license and figured the short range and high frequency would make us harder to catch. We were doing what they call in radio terminology \"bootlegging\" Some evenings we'd double date but each in a separate car, he in his father's car and me in my mother's car. We'd start out with our transceivers and communicate back and forth as we drove along in different parts of town. We'd even let our dates talk to each other, which impressed them tremendously. Then we'd agree to rendezvous at some ice-cream parlor or hamburger place. Jack Moriarty often joined Charlie and me to do some communication experiments along fence-lines. One of us would hook a battery operated telephone handset to the metal wire on the fence. The other guys would go further and further down the fence line, hook up their handset and we'd talk back and forth, sometimes a quarter or half mile away. It was a good thing that we didn't hook onto some farmer's electric fence. Charlie later took 3 ½ years of electrical engineering at Iowa State College when he decided to go into dentistry. I couldn't believe it because he had such big hand. Anyway he ended up as an orthodontist and taught dentistry at the University of Iowa. I guess when he had his dental practice he rigged all of the latest electrical devices including a TV screen in the ceiling over the dental chair. A classmate of mine named Jack Silverstein had his ham radio license so I used to enjoy going over to his house while he conversed with other ham operators around the country and even in some foreign countries. His call letters were W9 VUN. One day I was with Jack while we were talking to a ham operator in New York State. Suddenly the New York guy went off the air right in mid sentence. We tried to reestablish contact but couldn't so we just figured that he somehow lost power. About a month later Jack showed me an article in the American Radio Relay League journal (ARRL) that the operator had reached down to make an adjustment and somehow got hold of a live wire in his power supply and got electrocuted. During our 50*h Roosevelt High reunion in Des Moines in 1989, Jack came up to me and said \"Graydon, I'll bet you don't remember who I am\". I said \"I sure do, Jack, you're W9 VUN\" We then had a great time reminiscing. Another classmate and friend was George Towne. George lived in a great big house near Grand Avenue and has a lot of space, both in the house and in the yard, to pursue a collection of hobbies and interests. He had two four door Model T Fords, one for running around in and the other for parts. George's ambition was to drive his Model T from Coast to Coast and interested Life Magazine in filming the adventure. Life did come out and take pictures of the car with George standing by it and some pretty girls draped around it. For some reason, which I've forgotten, the trip was cancelled. Maybe it was illness in the family. George did all kinds of crazy things with his Model T. One time he removed all four doors and rigged it up so he could drive it from the back seat. Once he and I rode along, both of us in the back seat and no one in the front seats. People really did a triple take at the sight of a driverless Model T cruising down the street with two passengers in the back seat. Since George and I were both model railroad enthusiasts we built some pretty elaborate O gauge and HO gauge layouts at his house. A few years later, when I was an associate editor for the Iowa State University - IOWA ENGINEER magazine he and I collaborated on an article entitled \"Casey Jones in Miniature\". A copy of it will be included when I get to my college days part of this Remembrances. Roosevelt High had some pretty strong rivalries with North High, Ames High, Marshalltown High, etc. and etc. In fact everyone was out to clean our clocks in sports and otherwise. More often than not, we cleaned theirs. One of the most bitter rivalries was with North High in Des Moines. One evening, after a game, kids from both schools gathered at the Roosevelt shopping center and really started a ruckus. The police came out to try to restore order. Air was let out of one of the police care tires and the radio was ripped out in another. It was getting pretty nasty. Paul Bridwell had parked and left his date in the car while he went into the ice-cream parlor to get ice cream cones for his date and him about the time police reinforcements arrived along with a couple of paddy wagons. Well, poor innocent Paul got scooped up by the police along with the guilty and loaded into a paddy wagon. It was late into the night before Paul could get released and get back to his dateless car—his date had called her parents to her rescue. His charges were later dropped. I was present when things started turning sour but didn't want to be involved so I left in time. We had neighbors across the street who had a boy just a little younger than me who was mentally retarded in some ways. He was always friendly but difficult to carry on a conversation with and understand. He did have agift of being able to calculate things in his head real fast. For example, I'd give him my birth-date and immediately he could tell me what day of the week I was born on. He could do complicated math in his head. He was able to ride a bicycle which, that one day, developed a flat tire. I saw that he was in distress about it so I offered to fix it for him. I shot a rubber band patch into the tire and in about an hour had the wheel back on and he was on his way. The next day he showed up at our front door with a cake for me. I don't know whether he or his mother baked it and I really couldn't ask for fear it might embarrass him. Anyway they were appreciative beyond my expectations and the cake was really good. About a half mile west of our house, kind of out in the country toward the country club, was a huge abandoned foundation. It consisted of a lot of concrete pillars, which supported a concrete deck about ten or twelve feet above the ground. It originally was to become a tire plant but was never completed. In later years it was purchased by a company which built a huge dance pavilion named Val Aire. Many of the big bands later played there. I used to take Smokey and hike over to the foundation to just kind of explore and mess around. It was possible to climb up onto the concrete deck from one corner. So I'd hoist Smokey up onto it and then climb up myself. One day we were up there when I picked up a stick and threw it for Smokey to retrieve. I hadn't noticed a big hole in the deck when I threw the stick but Smokey managed to go galloping right over it. Only he didn't make it all the way across and dropped on through to the ground below. When I got down there he was kind of shaken up but otherwise OK. I don't think he fully trusted my stick throwing after that. I dated a lot of different girls since I didn't want anything serious to develop with any particular one. I enjoyed their company and treated each one as a friend. I think most of them understood, although I never mentioned or discussed Jane. I did have some embarrassing moments. One day when I was shopping downtown with mother, a classmate, Sally Reiniger passed by. She said something in greeting and as I turned to respond and wave I stepped into a mud puddle. She and her mother and my mother all started to laugh but I didn't think it was funny at the time. Now I do. Another time I had a date to go to a play at the KRNT Theater. When we arrived, I backed the car into a parking spot and started around the back of the car to open her door. We were talking about something as I walked around the car not knowing that I had backed up to an open stairwell. Well, I was interrupted in mid sentence as I disappeared down that stairwell. Fortunately I only ended up with a few scrapes and bruises and torn trousers. We arrived early enough for me to find a men's restroom for some repair and we still made it to the play. I imagine some people sitting near us must have wondered what had happened to me. Did she do it or some guy? The Ledges State Park near Boone, Iowa was always one of our favorite for picnics, hiking and a good day's outing. The Ledges had some spectacular cliffs, canyons and many fjords where the river trickled right across the road four to six inches deep in places. During the fall, the colors were just gorgeous. Sometimes a bunch of us fellows would go there to climb and hike and sometimes we took dates or just got together a joint group of boys and girls. There were lots of picnic tables and places for volleyball and other lawn sports. Our whole family, Mother, Dad, Marcia, Barbara and I, also enjoyed a number of outings at the ledges. By the way, Mother Let me use her little Chevy anytime I wished when she was not using it. The condition was as long as I kept it washed, polished, spotless inside and maintained the oil and water, air in the tires and ran her errands when she needed me to. One day Mother and I looked out the front window and there was Marcia with her dukes up and squared away to deck a neighbor boy who apparently had said the wrong thing to her or tried to push her around. There was no doubt in our minds that Marcia would prevail in that encounter so we just watched as the boy backed down and left. Mother and Dad frequently entertained and were entertained with their wide circle of business and social friends. One evening Mother and Dad got all dressed up in formals and tux and awaited the arrival of someone who was to pick them up for a party somewhere. Pretty soon a huge moving van pulled up in front of the house, a uniformed attendant stepped out of the rear and came up to the house to summon them to the party. A footman set down some steps and Mother and Dad entered the moving van which was all decorated and equipped with a bar, chairs and a small four or five piece orchestra. It made the round to all of the invited guest's houses and really got the party rolling before any one even arrived at the place where it was being thrown. By the way, one of the hosts owned the moving van company. I think it was sometime during the summer of 1938 that Barbara spent part of the summer at Grandma Taphouse's house in New York Mills, Minnesota. She took care of a horse named Paint during her visit. Paint appeared in the movie, The Plainsman. You'll have to ask Barbara about the details that I think I have correct so far. A picture of Barbara up on Paint is below. By midsummer of 1938 I'd earned enough money for a bus trip to Philadelphia to visit Jane and was a guest at her folk's house. It was a big two-story house on Woodbine Avenue in Narberth, Pennsylvania. While I was there Jane showed me many of the Historic spots in Philadelphia, we went to Filly's baseball games and took a trip to Washington, D.C. where we stayed with her aunt and uncle. It was my first visit to Washington so she enjoyed taking me on a tour of the Capital and historic spots. We also visited nearby beaches for lots of swimming. Back in Narberth, one night I'd just gone to bed in the upstairs guest bedroom when things started to shake, the pictures swung sideways on the wall and some bric-a-brac on the dresser came tumbling to the floor. It was a mild earthquake but sure was scary. We all stayed up to the wee hours assessing the damage, putting things back in order and wondering if another tremor would follow. It didn't One day Jane and I and a friend of hers went shopping and exploring at one of the big Philadelphia department stores. At one point we agreed to split up and then meet later at a central location in the store. I went off by myself to do some shopping, I think for a present for Jane or her folks. When I returned to the meeting point she was sitting there with her friend smoking a cigarette. Since I didn't smoke and had no idea that she did I guess I looked a bit stunned. Anyway she immediately put out the cigarette. I didn't say a word and the subject was never raised. I really didn't object to her smoking but guess I was just surprised that she did and was maybe a little disappointed. Back in Des Moines in the fall of 1938, Dad came down with pneumonia. Rather than placing Dad in a hospital, the doctor had a diathermy machine installed in the bedroom and really sweated the pneumonia out of him. He had a part or full time nurse and was out of commission for a matter of weeks. The diathermy machine must have been pretty powerful because the light in the house dimmed every time it came on. The financial drain from the illness must have been substantial because Mother and Dad later sold the house and moved to a rented 2 ½ story duplex at 5129 W. Grand Avenue. There were three bedrooms and a bath on the second floor and my bedroom was in the third floor attic section. See picture below. To reach the stairs to my bedroom I had to traverse one corner of Mother and Dad's bedroom. It was kind of unhandy if I stayed out late after they'd gone to bed. Besides, two of the treads on the stairway to my bedroom creaked. I learned to count the stairs and then skip those steps when it was prudent to do so. Reese Tuttle, our Des Moines Register and Tribune sportswriter, lived in the adjoining duplex and turned out to be an interesting and well informed neighbor on many subjects as well as sports. Since my bedroom was quite large, I had plenty of room for my various and sundry hobbies and equipment. One problem was the distance from the first floor kitchen to my room— especially when Mother wanted me for something or I needed to ask her a question. To solve this problem I rigged up a big twelve inch magnetic speaker in the kitchen and connected it to another in my room and built a little amplifier and switch buttons to tie the two together to form a PA system all controllable from my room. It worked great. What I didn't tell Mother was that I could turn up the volume and eavesdrop on conversations clear from the living room. It was great when a party was going on downstairs. My conscience did bother me a little so I confessed and changed things so it would just pick up conversations from the kitchen. The driveway went down from the street at a real steep angle and led to our garage that was in the basement of the duplex. It was rather unhandy when there was much ice or snow on the ground and we had to put cinders on the driveway to get the cars out. During a recent visit to Des Moines I notice the driveway has been filled in. We lived somewhat closer to the Roosevelt shopping center and Roosevelt High so I could easily walk the mile or two to both. Often when Mother wanted me to mail a letter of run an errand or I just wanted to go shopping I would take Smokey along for the walk to the shopping center. Smokey was a rather unusual looking dog so people would stop me on the street and inquire about his ancestry. It was a great way to get acquainted with people in the neighborhood. Sometimes girls would be out walking their pooches in the evening so Smokey was also able to get acquainted and meet a few girl dogs. One evening, as I was starting out on my walk, a girl approached me and started a conversation. She said that she worked for the family that lived in the huge house across the street from us. She also said that the family was away on vacation and that she was all alone in the house and even afraid to go to bed at night for fear that someone was lurking under the bed. I figured that she was seeking advice so suggested that she tape a knife to a broom-handle and stick it under the bed before she climbed in - also that she keep the phone real handy to call the police. That seemed to end the conversation and I continued on with my walk. One evening we had some kind of school social activity involving dates. My date was Mary Ann Cassiday. Her dad owned the most exclusive women's department store in Des Moines Norman Cassiday's. After the social activity four or five couples of us decided to explore an old abandoned mansion on Grand Avenue, which everyone referred to as the haunted house. When we arrived at the haunted house, I parked our car in the driveway. We found the front door ajar so there was no forced entry. With flashlights in hand we explored from room to room on the first floor and then up the grand staircase to the second floor. It was rather spooky so we all stuck pretty close together. Then someone noticed that there was an extra flashlight outside our close knit group and an extra person. We swung our flashlights around and there stood a big policeman right in our midst. I looked out the window and there was a patrol car parked right across the driveway entrance so there was no point in trying to duck out. Mary Ann was terrified about what her folks would say if she ended up in the pokey. We were able to talk our way out of the situation and got off with a warning. In 1989, at our 50\" High School reunion, Mary Ann asked me if I could remember who the others in our group at the haunted house were. The only one I could remember was George Towne and his date. George didn't make it to the reunion but if we could have remembered the others I suppose we would have ended up with a mini reunion. One Saturday Dad let me use his car for the day. I picked up George, Charlie and Jack and we drove out to the airport to see a new United Airlines Mainliner and then to fort Des Moines where we flew one of George's gasoline powered model airplanes. We then decided to drive to the Ledges. The other guy offered to buy the gas but I decided that Dad might not like our driving that far so I disconnected the speedometer/odometer cable. It was after dark before I dropped the guys off and drove home, quietly snuck the car into the garage and tippy-toed up to my room. The next morning I woke up and remembered that I hadn't reconnected the speedometer cable. So I snuck down to the garage but found that Dad had already left the house. Later, after he had returned, I checked again and found that the cable had been reconnected. Dad didn't say a word for a couple of days until one night, when we had company for dinner, Dad said \"Graydon, I notice that you discovered how to disconnect the odometer when you had the car the other day. I'm just curious about one thing and that is— why don't you just park when you want to neck instead of driving the car all over the city of Des Moines?\" Needless to say, I never disconnected the cable after that. Our Church affiliation at that time was the Congregational Church on Ingersol Avenue. It was a beautiful cathedral like church. Dr. Stoddard Lane was our minister and well known and respected, both locally and nationally. I was active in my Sunday school class, which often met with Dr. Lane who planned activities with other churches in the area. Periodically we would meet with other groups at a Synagogue or Catholic Church where Stoddard Lane, Rabbi Manheimer and Father O'Brien would have a round- table discussion on topics of the day and bring us into the discussion. All three had a terrific sense of humor, so we really enjoyed the mental stimulus and the fun of the meetings. We also developed a better understanding of the other churches and world and local issues of the day. Thad an old Underwood portable typewriter which mother gave to me back in Detroit. Having taken typing lessons in high school, I got pretty proficient which came in handy in writing reports and working on the \"Weekly Roosevelt Roundup\" newspaper. Of course on the newspaper the type could be set in columns and justified. I decided instead of writing letters to Jane that I'd publish to her a one or two page newspaper with drawings to illustrate some of my activities. I worked hours typing and retyping and counting the letters and spaces so I could get the columns to come out both right and left justified. Since we didn't have Zerox machines in those days my total circulation was one. I wasn't even able to keep a copy for myself. We had a little theater nearby called the Kendell Community Playhouse. The theater group consisted of many talented people in Des Moines, including a few from Roosevelt High. I used to do some backstage work and I think Barbara was also involved. Once every several months a new play would open. It was a tiny theater that would seat about two hundred people so seats were always in demand. Later the theater company moved to the Roosevelt Shopping Center into what was once the Roosevelt movie theater and is now named The Playhouse. We also had a huge auditorium at Roosevelt High. Most of us ate lunch in the cafeteria at school. Then after lunch and before classes began they would show movies in the auditorium. Because we only had fifteen or twenty minutes of movie time the films were shown in installments over four or five days. One show I well remember was \"It Happened One Night' with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert. We virtually lived from one day's lunch period to the next see the next episode. I worked backstage on one or our big annual high school play called the \"Silver Frolics\". One part of it involved a talent show. George and I built a big fancy applause machine with a row of lights in the front. The louder people clapped the more lights came on. During the show we wheeled the machine onto the stage and explained, in highly technical terms, how it could sense the level of applause and that it was up to the audience to pick the winner. What they didn't know was that I was offstage with a rotary switch that controlled the number of lights and was judging the applause by ear. I didn't dare turn on too many lights too early in the contest for fear of running out of them if later contestants were better. On the other hand I couldn't turn on too few lights too early in the contest in case the following contestants were not as good. So I only went halfway up the scale on the first one to be safe in both directions. Right in the middle of the darn contest someone tripped over our cord backstage and put the machine out of commission. So we hurriedly rounded up a panel of judges, which included George and me, and ruled on who was the winner. I believe it was Marjory \"Punch\" Nutt. The largest department store in Des Moines was, and still is, Younkers. On the third floor they have a restaurant called the Younkers Tea Room. It is a favorite for shopper's luncheons and also evening dinners. About once a month the Younkers Tea Room had a dinner/dance/theater special which included dinner- dancing with a theater ticket included for after dinner at one of the nearby theaters. A standby for live music was piano playing by Louis Wertz. He was fantastic and a few years later changed his name to Roger Williams. I probably went to half of the dinner- dance evenings. It was great evening entertainment. One of Barbara's best friends was a girl named Peggy Loeber. Peggy was a striking, fiery redhead. Of course Barbara was s striking, green-eyed platinum blond. When they were together they didn't have any trouble recruiting me as an escort or chauffeur. People really did a double take when they saw me walking down the street with those two, one on each arm. One of my classmates was a great big black boy, James Thompson. We all called him \"Chocolate\" Thompson, a nickname which he picked up as a child and which he didn't mind. He was our star football player and just a peach of a guy who we all liked. In later years he served as a Des Moines police officer and detective. Years later, when Sara was in Marshalltown High, Marshalltown played my old school, Roosevelt, in the boy's basketball finals. I went down to the game with Sara and her girl friends and sat in the Marshalltown cheering section trying to support my old alma mater, Roosevelt, without much success. I spied \"Chocolate\" working the police detail at the game. I wasn't quite sure he'd remember me so wasn't quite sure that I should call him \"Chocolate\" '. So I simply said Hi and he did remember me. Later at our 50th 'reunion \"Chocolate\" and others who were on the football team concluded that they could still beat the 1939 Ames, Marshalltown and any other team that came our way. Ballroom dancing was a big activity in those days because of the many great Bib Bands that were around. Most came to the Fairgrounds or Val Aire in Des Moines and to the Surf Ballroom at Clear Lake, Iowa. One evening someone in our group sponsored a formal dance at Younkers Tea Room. I asked Marjory Zing, who was a class behind mine, to go to the dance. So that evening I picked her up and on the way to the dance she looked at the invitation and discovered that we were an hour early. At that time we happened to be passing by the Des Moines Boat Club, on the Des Moines river, so on the spur-of-the-moment we decided to rent a canoe and go canoeing-tux, formal and all and not one lifejacket. After paddling upstream for 15 or 20 minutes we decided to head back downstream and turn in the canoe. On the way downstream, we were going likkedy cut when I, at the back of the canoe, started a turn to the dock. This caught Marjorie by surprise and she somehow got per paddle caught under the canoe and over we went. As I came up I looked around for Marjorie and discovered that she was rounding up the paddle and canoe and was looking for me to rescue. Fortunately we were in not much more than five feet of water so soon had our feet on the ground or should I say, in it. We waded ashore in the muck and mud over ankle deep. Someone on the dock asked us what society would say. Marjorie snapped back \"Who the hell is society?\" We spent the rest of the evening walking and driving around trying to get reasonably dried out and putting together a story for our parents. We finally decided that the unvarnished truth was the best strategy. Later I did make up for that evening by taking Marjorie to the Iowa State Fair where Paul Whiteman and his band were playing. As for academics, I got A's and B's except for college algebra. I had learned a certain bookkeeping method for algebra when I was in Detroit which didn't agree with the system taught by my Roosevelt math teacher, Miss Mears. I'd get the right answer but got marked down to C's and D's because I used the wrong method or rather I didn't use her method. Later I repeated college algebra at Iowa State College and go straight A's. I was tempted to go back and show Miss Mears but never did. Finally, graduation day rolled around and about 400 of us were thrust into the world of employment or were college bound. By that time I really felt like a true Roosevelt Roughrider. Before we moved from Detroit I had my heart set on attending the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Many of my friends from Detroit would attend and we were all avid Michigan big ten football fans. There just was no other school to compare. However, Mother and Dad were trying to convince me that I should consider Iowa State College in Ames. I think part of it was involved with the difference in tuition. I thought of Iowa State as just an agricultural cow college stuck of in Timbucktu compared to prestigious U of M. Dad finally made a deal with me. He said \"Graydon, why don't you go up to Ames and work there during the summer. This will get you acquainted with the college. Then if you still are set on the University of Michigan we'll see what we can work out.\" So I said \"OK\". Since Dad had insurance agents all over the state of lowa he and I drove to Ames where he introduced me to Waldo McDowell, who was his company's agent in Ames. I think Waldo mentioned that Adam's Mortuary took on students during the summer, to drive their ambulance and do odd jobs around the mortuary. So we drove over there and I met the owner, Mr. Jay Adams. Before we left I had nailed down the job which essentially took care of my room and some pay. It was not a full time job though. Next we visited the campus where I met Ray Cunningham, the director of activities at Iowa State College. He said that the YWCA was undergoing a complete interior redecoration and that I could wok on that project. So now I had a place to stay and two jobs to earn money and defray some of my college costs, whichever school I picked. Ultimately, with this job and various others during my college days, I was able to earn a little more than 60 percent of my way through school. Some of the balance I borrowed on student loans and paid back later. Of course Mother and Dad also helped out. The next chapter of this narrative will deal with my experiences that summer in Ames and then on through college until I entered the armed services in 1943, at the beginning of World War I. * * * It was now the spring of 1939, right after high school graduation. It was time to head for Ames and the summer job at Adams Mortuary. I hitched a ride with Dad who had some business to do with his Ames insurance agent, Waldo McDowell. Dad dropped me off at the mortuary and from that moment I was on my own. The mortuary was and still is located on the east side of downtown Ames and one block north of the main street. The location is at the corner of Douglas and 5th Street. The mortuary is a large, brick, two story mansion like structure. The main floor consists of waiting rooms and chapel in the front and in the back were the offices and the mort facility where bodies were embalmed and prepared for burial. In those days we hadn't heard of cremation yet. A big double door entrance was also at the rear and opened onto the driveway which was protected by an overhead patio roof. I took this picture of the mortuary in the summer of 1992. On the second floor were the living quarters in front which included the Adam's bedroom and the maid's bedroom. The rear hall of the second floor was taken up by the display of caskets. The basement contained the garage for the ambulance, hearse and limousines and opened out onto the east end driveway which turned one way onto 5th Street and wrapped around to the rear of the mortuary in the other direction and up to the covered rear entrance patio. The front yard consisted of a well kept lawn with flowered borders all of which were set off from the sidewalk by a low brick wall topped by decorative ironworks that extended upward six or seven feet. My living quarters were also in the basement right next to the ambulance garage. It was kind of a one room efficiency apartment which included my sleeping area and a kitchen area for cooking and eating. I had the sleeping and eating part pretty well down pat but the cooking part was to become a rather new experience since Mother had always taken care of that detail up until now. The owner of the mortuary was Mr. Jay Adams. He and Mrs. Adams lived at the Mortuary. His three sons were Clint, Chev and Frank Adams. They and their families lived in other parts of the town but worked during the day at the mortuary helping Jay who was getting along in years. My ambulance duties were to drive the ambulance at night and at other times when none of the sons were available. The daytime duties were only occasional and were arranged ahead of time so I could work at my other jobs. The first few days were spent getting acquainted with my ambulance driving duties. The ambulance was a white Buick, constructed similar to a hearse with two big doors at the rear. It had rotating red flashing lights above the cab and a siren. A lever was on the floorboard which allowed the driver to adjust the spring tension for different types of road conditions. At first I just rode along with Frank or Clint to learn the ropes and get to know the Ames street layouts as well as the hospital locations. The stretchers were kept in a room next to the rear entrance. When a call came in we drove the ambulance to the rear entrance, loaded the warm stretcher into the ambulance and then too off for the location. Sometimes we had to transfer a patient from the hospital to home or vice versa while other calls involved accidents. The only ambulance service available in Ames was provided by one of the two mortuaries. I believe the name of the other mortuary was Dutton or something like that. When there was a need for more than one ambulance, such as a highway accident, both mortuaries responded. What made Mr. Adams angry was the fact that we always arrived at the scene of an accident first and took the injured to one of the hospitals. Dutton would get there last and take any people who were killed to his mortuary and thus reap the embalming, casket and possible funeral profits. I quickly learned that this was somewhat of a cutthroat business. After a few days of riding along I got to drive the ambulance. Fortunately the first few calls were rather routine, non accident, and I had Frank or Clint along. My dread was to, some night, having to respond to an accident call all by myself since I was not trained in first aid. Jay assured me that there would always be highway patrolmen and others at the scene, who would take care of the injured, help load them onto the stretcher and into the ambulance. All I had to do then was to rush to the nearest hospital where other emergency medical aid would be available. Believe me I became the \"carefullest\" ambulance driver anywhere around, not only for the victims safety but also for my own. Although I always had the right of way I never assumed anyone would yield it to me. I also had to brake slowly and slow down before turning a corner when I had a patient aboard. So on the way to an emergency was one thing, as far as driving was concerned, but once I had a patient aboard then I had to drive much more gingerly. Thinking back to my high school driver education training in Detroit, I realized how much of a help it had become, and how much driving the ambulance was underlining and supplementing that training. By anticipating situations which could develop a block ahead or even a quarter mile ahead on the highway, I quickly learned defensive driving. Since I had to be on deck at the mortuary in the evenings I had plenty of time for reading writing letters and doing some studying for the college registration exams. I wrote to Jane about every two or three days recounting my adventures at Ames. Another duty that popped up once a week was mowing the lawn in front of the mortuary. This had to be kept well manicured because it was so visible from the street. Sometimes in the evening I'd sit out on the patio visiting with Mr. Adams. We used to get into some pretty deep philosophical discussions that got rather heated on occasion. I think at times we each took the opposite sides of an issue just for the sake of argument. Once we disagreed about the measurement of success. Jay claimed that the most important measure was how much money a person could make and accumulate. I, of course, claimed that the real measure was a person's contribution to others and to society in general rather than what he selfishly accumulated for himself at the expense of others. Money was important but only secondary as a tool to accomplish other unselfish ends. Neither of us ever won but it sure was stimulating. After a few days of getting acquainted with the duties at the mortuary it was time to report for my daytime job at the lowa State College YWCA. Since I didn't have the use of a car I had to take the bus out to the campus. Much of the work on redecorating the YW was well under way so the job would last for just a couple of weeks. It consisted of standing on scaffolding and removing years of accumulated calcimine from the walls and ceiling. It had to be wetted first and then removed with scrapers. Boy did I look a mess at the end of the day from goopy calcimine which dripped down onto my coveralls and even into my underclothes. Now that I think back, in all my years at lowa State I never did revisit the Y WCA to see how the decorating project finally turned out. One bonus about the work at the YWCA was that after work I also found time to tour the campus and get acquainted with the street layout, the various departments and some of the people connected with the school. I was quite impressed with the beauty of the campus and the size. Dogtown was also intriguing to me. I began to think that this might not be such a bad place to go to school after all. Another bonus was the size of the school. At that time the total enrollment was only about 6,000 so a person wouldn't feel as lost as he would in one of the much larger schools. It was interesting to me that unlike some other colleges, the town of Ames and the college were physically separated by a stretch of flood plane flatlands. It seemed that the town and the college each had its own character and set of interesting people and other attributes. Yet the two were also interdependent to some extent. During the summer I got to know the personalities of both. When I had completed the work at the YW I started looking around for another daytime job. I mentioned this to Mr. Adams who said he had a job for me if I'd be interested. It seems that sometimes a mortuary acquires property in settlement of funeral expenses. Mr. Adams had just such a house and it needed painting. I said sure I'd take the job since I didn't figure painting a house would take a lot of skill. Mr. Adams took me to see the house which was located just south of the railroad tracks and about a block east of highway 69. It was about a half mile walk from the mortuary. The house was a large white two story wood frame structure with a one story attached section. The exterior paint was cracked and peeling and bare wood was exposed in some spots. It was a mess. Too late to back out. The next day I loaded a couple of extension ladders into the mortuary pickup truck and drove to the paint store where I purchased buckets of white primer and white paint, brushes, a scraper, drop cloths and other painting stuff on the mortuary account. I kept the excess primer and paint at the mortuary until needed. The ladders stayed on the job. I'd carry the paint I needed each day from the mortuary to the job. Sometimes it took two trips. I started at the highest points on the second floor scrapping the old paint down to the bare wood as best I could. Then after getting a section cleared as far as I could reach from the ladder in all directions I'd haul up a bucket of primer and brush it onto the bare wood. Then I moved the ladder onto the next section and repeated the operation. The windows and trim were especially difficult and I had to use a combination of the scraper, some steel wool and softener to get the paint loose. After applying the prime I would later come back over the same area twice again to apply two coats of oil base white paint to finish that area. I worked while stripped to the waist and developed a deep suntan, both front and back. The front tan was from the reflected sunlight on the white paint. One day I reached the second floor section located above the roof of the one story extension. This would be great since I could stand on the roof instead of the ladder. The trouble was that I discovered a hornet's nest in the eves just under the two story roof. I decided to set fire to the hornet's nest and then knock it to the ground. So with some kerosene on wadding at the end of a stick, another stick and a garden hose, I mounted the one story roof away from the hornet's nest. I crawled over the roof toward the nest, lit the wadding and applied it to the bottom of the nest. Once the nest was well ignited I knocked it to the ground before any of the eves could become ignited. If they had caught fire, I had the hose as a backup. I still shudder when I think about what I did. But I got away with it, almost. Apparently some of the hornets were away from home when I did my dastardly deed and they were rather unhappy to find their home gone. I was on the roof when they returned. I decided that this would be a good time to take the rest of the day off. One day while I was putting the final coat on an area on the second floor siding, my ladder got against the wet paint and started sliding sideways. I rode with it to the corner of the house where I was able to grab a down spout and check the ladder from going any further. But I couldn't let go of the down spout and go down the ladder. Fortunately some men from a car paint shop across the street saw my predicament and rushed over to fasten a rope to the ladder, holding it in place while I descended. I think that I worked on that house for three weeks including weekends. When I was done it looked great. Then Mr. Adams raised the rent on the tenants. I thought that was kind of unfair since he hadn't warned them ahead of time. Oh well, such is the cruel world of land lordship and profit and loss. In the meantime I had a few calls with the ambulance but nothing real serious. A couple of calls were convalescent runs from the hospital to home which were times of happiness for the people involved. However, there was one call I'll never forget. At the time I was the only one at the mortuary to take the call. It was from a residence where they thought a gentleman was having an attack of appendicitis. I wheeled the ambulance out of the garage, onto the street and started the flashing lights and siren. About two blocks away I glanced back and realized that I'd forgotten to load the stretcher. My only choice was to make a quick U turn and head back for the stretcher. Some pedestrians looked at me kind of funny wondering what was going on. I got the stretcher loaded and again took off for the residence. When I arrived and went up to the house to check on the patient and to get help with the stretcher, he had recovered enough to insist on riding to the hospital up front with me. He told me he had been a guest for dinner when the attack came on but during the delay while waiting for the ambulance the symptoms subsided. It did turn out to be appendicitis and his appendix was removed that evening. Once in a while I'd be asked to drive the black LaSalle hearse or one of the Cadillac family limousines during a funeral. On two occasions it was the limousine. I always attended strictly to the driving unless the family had questions or otherwise wanted to engage me in conversation. In one instance I just wanted to be left alone. Some gal was weeping and wailing and felt so sorry for herself that it was downright disgusting to me. At the other extreme a gentleman and his two young daughters discussed the wonderful life they had enjoyed together with his wife and their mother who had just died from an extended illness. They asked me about the cemetery and commented on the beautiful day. I had a hard time holding back the tears. My worst nightmare occurred one evening when we got a call about and accident between a semi and a car on the bridge just east of town on highway 30. Fortunately Frank was with me because use I don't think I could have handled it alone. A girl in her late teens was critically injured. She died before we could get her to the hospital. I knew her. I couldn't sleep the rest of that night and it took me a long time to get over the vision of that wreck, even now. Today when I see an accident I have no desire to stop unless I'm the only help available. If other people are there I just want to keep going. One morning Clint told me that he'd like me to make a run with him to Rochester, Minnesota that evening with the hearse. Someone had died at Mayo and was to be buried in Ames. This was to be an overnight run up there and back by morning. It ended up that I did most of the driving with Clint admonishing me to bear down a little harder on the accelerator. Since there were no speed limits in those days I had that LaSalle hearse up to 70 and 75 miles per hour. I don't think a lot of cars we passed were used to seeing a hearse go that fast. Sometime after dark, in the middle of nowhere there was a loud bang as one of the tires blew out. I was surprised that the hearse held the road so well so I just let it coast to a stop without touching the brakes. Clint wasn't quite sure what to do next so I just took over. I dug out the jack and tools and changed the tire in about 15 minutes while he held a flashlight for me. About midnight we made it to Mayo, picked up the coffin, had a little midnight snack and immediately headed back to Ames. We arrived back just about dawn. Then I hit the sack, rather exhausted. Apparently, by that time, Jay Adams approved of my performance because he hinted that I might think about becoming a mortician. In fact he invited me to sometime come into the mort room and witness an embalming. By that time I had decided the last thing I ever wanted to do was to either observe and embalming or to become a mortician, much less become an ambulance driver or even a doctor. I just wasn't emotionally put together to cope with any of these professions. I had heard that Smith Cold Storage Lockers in downtown Ames was looking for some daytime help during the summer months so I decided to apply. I was hired but couldn't start to work until the next day. Mr. Smith told me to bring along some warm clothing, earmuffs and mittens which I had to call home for and have sent up on the evening bus from Des Moines. Smith Cold Storage Lockers served both residential and small business customers by cutting, wrapping, freezing and storing meat and other foods which customers wanted frozen and stored in lockers. In one cold room were the various band saws, knives and other tool for cutting, wrapping and labeling the meats. From there they went into the quick freeze room which was 10 below zero (if I remember correctly) where they were stacked on shelves for fast freezing. Finally after being frozen the packages were transferred to the customer's locker in a room held at about 10 above zero. The workers wore white shop coats over their own clothing. It was quite a shock to work in the quick freeze and storage room all day and then come out doors where the temperature was 85 and 90 degrees and humid. I did help with some of the simpler meat cutting but most of it was done by Mr. Smith or another professional butcher. My job was mainly to help wrap, label, freeze and store the meats and other foods which the customers brought in. The wrapping was done in a kind of waxed paper and taped and then covered with white parchment paper and labeled. The refrigeration system, in those days, consisted of a compressor which handled ammonia as the refrigerant. When compressed the ammonia is a liquid but changes to a gas as it passes through a cooling coil and absorbs heat from the air. The liquid ammonia was stored in a tank about 30 to 40 gallons in capacity which was equipped with a sight glass to indicate the ammonia level in the tank. Each end of the sight glass was equipped with a ball check valve so if the sight glass broke none of the ammonia in the tank could escape, only that in the sight glass itself. One day the sight glass did get broken. Just the tiny amount of ammonia in the sight glass drove everyone in the building out onto the street until repairs could be made. Boy was that stuff potent. Nowadays Freon is used instead, but even that is about to be replace as environmentally unsafe. One day one of the locker customers came in to let Mr. Smith know they were moving out-of-town and were going to vacate their locker. They didn't want to take the contents with them and told Mr. Smith to dispose of it. He told me that I could have whatever I wanted and that for a limited time I could use the locker. Boy did I enjoy taking home steaks and other meats to cook at the mortuary. Talk about eating high on the hog! One evening Frank asked me to take the pickup and go to the railroad station to pick up a body which was being shipped in from another city for burial in Ames. It was customary for the mortician who did the embalming to also provide the casket before shipment. If a vault is to be provided then the mortuary at the location of burial sells that to the family. Well, I got to the station and backed up to the baggage car. Out comes the casket encased in a cement vault and weighing what seemed like a ton. It set that poor little pickup down on the bottom of its springs. When I got to the mortuary Mr. Adams took one look and literally blew his stack. This unethical behavior not only cost Adams the sale of a vault it also cost the customer outlandish shipping charges. I never did hear how this all ended but I'm sure the other mortician got an earful from Mr. Adams. I did a lot of errands with the pickup. Some were hauling shelters, winches, etc. to the cemetery for use at burials. At other times it was hauling folding chairs to some event or party which rented them from the mortuary. It seems that many mortuaries in those days also owned furniture stores and provided furniture rentals. Adams had a black boy who did odd jobs around the mortuary and at the cemetery. One day he and I had to make a trip for something east of town on highway 30. On the way I noticed a watermelon stand with a sign that said all you can eat on the spot \"FREE\". On the way back I swung the pickup into the watermelon business to enjoy their offer. Well, the other guy and I got into a watermelon eating contest and he won hands down. One night, toward the end of summer, I got a call about an accident north of town about 15 miles on highway 69. When I arrived at the accident it was at a T intersection where a farm to market road from the west intersects with highway 69 which runs north and south. It turned out that a motorcycle on the farm to market road had run a stop sign and struck the rear end of a northbound car with such an impact that it broke the motorcycle in two and catapulted its occupants over the trunk of the car and into a cornfield. When I arrive the highway patrolman had found one of the riders who was still conscious and who told him that there were two others, a girl and a boy, on the cycle. We pulled both the patrol car and ambulance as far off the road as we could and played both spotlights into the cornfield to look for the other two. We finally found them all alive but with multiple fractures. We loaded two into the ambulance and the least seriously hurt into the patrol car and headed for the hospital. All survived their injuries, none of which was life threatening. So that was a taste of my eventful summer at Adams mortuary. I was able to stay on a little longer while starting the registration process at Iowa State College ad looking for another place to live closer to the campus. I finally did locate a room on Russell Street just north of Lincolnway. It was still in Ames proper but just before crossing the Skunk Creek bridge heading toward the campus. I don't remember the name of the family from whom I rented the room but do remember that he was a cookie salesman and drove a truck to deliver cookies and such to markets in the county. Yes, I did get an occasional free box of cookies from him. IOWA STATE COLLEGE REGISTRATION I don't remember much about the registration process except that I first got in a long line, was asked some basic questions and then was given a bunch of papers to fill out and questions to answer. I think that there was a test or two along the way but little of the process really got imprinted in my memory. I don't even remember the procedure for paying tuition. Iowa State College was on the quarter system rather than the semester system. That meant that there were three three-month quarters for each academic year rather than two 4 ½ month semesters. I liked this because it meant that we had three fresh starts in school each year rather than two. I started out taking 14 hours the firs quarter which was a pretty fair academic load. My classes included Chemistry, College Algebra, English, General Engineering, Military, Physical Education and Engineering Orientation. The last two were required courses without credit. The next step was to get our class schedules and to purchase the required textbooks and materials at the campus bookstore or the bookstore on Lincolnway in Dog Town. I had signed up for Mechanical Engineering with an Aeronautical Engineering minor since Aero Engineering was under the Mechanical Engineering department at the time. Most of the subjects in the freshman year were basic for all students. I could have tested out of some of them but felt that I should take these as refresher courses which would pay dividend later. Besides I wanted to prove to Miss Mears that I could get a better grade in College Algebra at Iowa State than I could get at Roosevelt High. I did get straight A's in the subject at Ames but never did go back to confront her with it. Somewhere along the line we had social events like the freshman mixer where we met other new students and exchanged names. Maybe there was even some dancing to break the ice. Somehow, after working all summer in Ames, I felt like an old timer among all of these other freshmen so could contribute useful information about Ames and the campus. Some of the freshmen were from my 1939 Roosevelt High graduating class. It was kind of interesting how different some of the girls looked than they did in high school. I suppose it was just my new perspective or maybe they really did mature during the summer. FRATERNITY LIFE There was also fraternity and sorority rushing. I had long ago made up my mind not to go out for rushing or to join a fraternity. It appeared to me that it would just be a distraction from the more serious business of obtaining an education. Also it would be an additional expense. Then one day someone at the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity somehow found out that my father was a member of Alpha Sigma Phi at Harvard. One of the members prevailed on me just to come over for dinner and to see the house. Then they really gave me the pitch about the fellowship, study help, social advantages and even financial advantages. They made quite a case and I was somewhat impressed but said I'd have to think it over. It was then that I decided to go out for rushing just to learn about the fraternity and sorority system and maybe make a few acquaintances along the way that might be helpful later on. Once I threw my hat in the ring I had about a dozen invitations but narrowed them down to three. One of the three was the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. When I visited the Phi Gam house I met four or five other freshmen rushees who were also in my Roosevelt graduation class. I also learned that I wouldn't be required to live in the fraternity house during my freshman year which would provide me with more flexibility. Anyway they were a bunch of my kind of guys so I went ahead and became a pledge. As evidence of this, each of the pledges were presented with a pin in the form of a white star. This identified us as Phi Gam pledges. One of the first Phi Gam social events, that I remember, was a formal dinner to which each of us invited a date. The pledges were strongly encouraged to bring a sorority girl. However, I was kind of independent and didn't like being told who I could date or invite to the dinner. Besides I'd met a town girl at the freshman mixer who I decided to invite. Her name was Helen Collins, nicknamed Collie. Her mother was a widow and an RN at the hospital. When I picked up Collie on the evening of the dinner she came to the door and I nearly fell off the porch. She was not only a very attractive girl but that evening she was stunning in her formal dress and with her hair done up in a turban. She turned out to be the focal point of the evening both in her appearance and by her conversation. The next day one of the Phi Gam seniors, Tom Little, asked me if I'd mind if he asked Collie for a date. That was the supreme compliment for my date taste and got me off the hook for not inviting a sorority girl. I told Tom to go ahead since I had no intention of dating any one girl and besides there was still Jane on my mind and in my correspondence. One of my pledge brothers, Kirk Bennett, and I became close friends. Since he also was living outside the fraternity house we decided to pool our resources and rent a place in a private home adjacent to the campus. Kirk and his sister Dorothy were both enrolled at Iowa State and were both interesting and talented people. The next few paragraphs will dwell on my experiences with them. I well remember when Kirk and I realized we'd need a bookshelf for all of our textbooks and other gear. So we bought some lumber and cobbled together and painted a five shelf-five foot long bookshelf. Then we proudly began loading it with our textbooks and other gear. About halfway through the shelf tilted to one side and collapsed into the shape of a pa;rallelogram. We just hadn't thought out the engineering structure of the thing. So we unloaded it and put a couple of cross braces at the rear which ;now qualified us as experience structural engineers. Kirk was enrolled in Chemical Engineering but his hobby was music. He played the piano and several wind instruments and also composed music. One of his piano concertos was once played by the Sioux City Symphony Orchestra. Kirk's father, Oliver Bennett was a lawyer and a colonel in the Iowa National Guard. His four uncles owned the Bennett Jewelry company which issued the Bennett Blue Book each year. They were wholesaler's for Tiffany's in New York among other major stores. During the summers Kirk and Dorothy would work in the sales department of Tiffany's. Kirk once told me that when a man came into the store wearing farmer's bib overalls he learned to treat him like royalty since the guy would probably find what he wanted and then pull out a roll of bills and pay on the spot in cash. I remember when Dorothy looked all over for a pair of shoes she would like to have. When she couldn't find them she sat down and designed the pair she wanted and then talked one of the shoe manufacturer's into making them for her. The manufacturer liked them so well he added them to his line. One day I learned that the fraternity was planning to break Kirk's pledge even though both his father and grandfather had been members of the Iowa State chapter of Phi Gamma Delta and, in fact, had served as president. It seems that the family of one of the current upperclassmen was in the construction business and had developed a family feud with the Bennetts, probably connected with some law suits. I told the members that if they broke Kirk's pledge they would have to break mine, which they didn't want to do. I discussed this with Kirk who told me to keep my pledge regardless of what happened to his and that I might be in a position to set the record straight later down the road. So they did break his and I did keep mine but in the process we became even closer friends. In fact, after W.W.II Kirk served as best man at Ruth Wilson's and my wedding. As I remember, I moved into the fraternity house during my second quarter which would have been sometime during the winter between 1939 and 1940. I guess I was kind of an independent renegade among the pledges because I didn't always do things according to protocol. One day the upperclassmen decided that two other pledges and I would have to run the gauntlet. To do so we had to start at the far end of the second floor hallway and try to make it to the stairs at the other end and down to the first floor. But we had all of our other pledge brothers in the hallway who were determined to grab us and usher us into a cold shower in the shower room just off the head of the stairway. To make their job more difficult the three of us stripped naked and then greased every inch of our bodies before we made our charge. I learned later that Bill Baird, who had been on the wrestling team at Roosevelt, said he would take me on alone. Since he was in one of the lighter weight classes I just took hold of him when he tried to wrestle me down and picked him up and started carrying him down the hall toward the stairway. Then he hollered for more help and another pledge joined him. While they were in the process of picking me up I managed to get each arm around each of their necks and realized I could bang their heads together and probably knock them out completely but couldn't bring myself to do so. I did get partway down the stairway by grabbing the railing and dragging them along with me but then ran out of steam. The outcome was that I didn't get showered because the two guys flopped me face down on a bed and applied antiseptic to my back which had become petty badly lacerated on the metal stair treads. The other two guys did get showered though. Finally I gave myself a shower to get the grease off. One day the first winter, while I was still a pledge, we had our first good snowfall. I'm not sure why but the thought occurred to me that it would be fun to lob snowballs onto guys walking up the front walk from the roof of the fraternity house which was 3 ½ stories up. So I climbed out the second floor dorm window onto a flat roof area and made myself a good supply of snowballs. Then I carried them up to the peak of the roof and waited for my victims. It was kind of funny because a snowball would come straight down and hit the sidewalk and I'd watch the consternation as the person would wonder where it came from. Before they looked up I could duck behind the ridge of the roof. Finally a couple of the actives figured out what was going on. So they came up to the second floor roof, made snowballs and started pelting me from behind. So there we were up on that roof having a real snowball fight. I finally charged down the sloped roof to a dorm window where some of my pledge brothers took hold of my shoulders to pull me in while the guys on the roof had hold of my legs trying to pull me out and give me a snow bath. I got the snow bath. During 1939 and the spring of 1940 fraternities were not required to have a housemother. So I must say that our deportment and table manners were not the best when just the guys were around. Then in the fall of 1940 the college ruled that each fraternity must have a housemother. At first this was devastating news to all of us who figured a fraternity was just for men and we didn't want to be inhibited by a woman in our presence. However we complied and were fortunate to get a wonderful housemother, Mrs. Rowe or Mother Rowe as we called her. Our table manners improved and it was really nice to have Mother Rowe so we could anytime bring our dates to the house. The nickname for Phi Gamma Delta was Fiji. So each year one of our functions was a Fiji Island party. We decorated the house with waterfalls and grass huts and wore grass skirts and other south sea island attire. The party was one of the highlights of the year. At the time Iowa and especially Iowa State College was dry. So we weren't allowed to have any hard liquor in the house. We could, however, have beer. A tradition for a graduating senior was to present the fraternity with a stein. These were lined along a board surrounding the dinning room wall. There were many beautiful steins imported from Germany and elsewhere. One of my favorites were a pair of pewter steins with glass bottoms so you could see the person across from you while drinking from it. We often used the dining room table for supervised study hall for the pledges and members who were having trouble with their grades. It seemed that we always had at least one expert in each subject and the fraternity had complete files of past examinations. So we had both a tutoring setup and a means to administer trial examinations on each subject. I wasn't exactly an all A student but my grades were sufficient to keep me out of the tutored group. I suppose my many extra curricular activities did hold me back a little. One week I was assigned the duty of wakeup boy. My duty consisted of taking the sheet where the members had marked when they wanted to be awakened in the morning and to be sure they were up. This was sometimes easier said than done. One guy would come out swinging even though I just touched him and whispered in his ear. Some had to be physically dragged out of their bunk while other would simply acknowledge the wakeup call and go back to sleep which we weren't allowed them to do. I remember one pledge who stuck a shotgun out of the dorm window one early morning and shouting \"Ducks, Ducks!!\" let go with both barrels. Every sleeping member came straight up out of his bunk and some in the lower bunks cracked their heads on the upper one. That pledge then disappeared somewhere for the rest of the day while a manhunt for him went on. Each year the fraternity system engaged in what was called \"Hell Week\". This was the week before pledges were initiated into the fraternities as full fledged active members. Some of the Hell Week activities were trivial or downright painful for the pledges in some fraternities. At our Phi Gam house we pledges were given the job of refinishing all of the dinning room furniture. It was not a pleasant job but a constructive one. We also had to learn the Greek alphabet and recite it backwards. Among the big events each year were Homecoming and Veishea. Each college department, dormitory, fraternity and sorority decorated their front yards for the Homecoming weekend when alumni, parents and guests visited the campus and we had a big football agame with another college or university. At Veishea most departments and houses made floats for the Veishea parade. By-the-way the word Veshea is derived from the first letters of each department - Veterinary, Engineering, Science, Home Economics and Agriculture. CAMPUS ACTIVITIES From the first day I enrolled at Iowa Sate I decided to participate in a variety of campus activities and organizations. I felt that a college education should provide more than just an academic education but should also prepare one for the social and civic responsibilities of the everyday world outside. I must say that this decision did somewhat inhibit my academic achievements but I never regretted the trade off. One of the first activities I signed up for in my freshman year was to work on the staff of the IOWA ENGINEER, the 39 page engineering department monthly magazine. I figured that I would put to good use some of the experience I had gained on high school publications and it would give me more visibility in the engineering department. After several months of orientation on the staff of the magazine I was assigned to edit the two centerfold pages titled \"Engineering FOCUS\". It consisted of four to six photographs illustrating the activities of one engineering company such as Westinghouse or General Electric. The company would agree to provide photograph cuts and describe the device or activity each photo represented in one or two paragraphs. My job was to solicit these photos cuts, arrange them in a two page spread and size the description in a block form that would be justified. Of course we included a statement such as \"Cuts Courtesy General Electric\" or whoever the donating company was. Also over my first three years on the staff I wrote maybe fifteen feature articles about engineering related subjects. Some of the titles were \"Casey Jones in Miniature\" about model railroading, \"The Eyes Have It\" about tracing eye movements, \"U 235 Power-- Maybe\" about the potential energy of uranium, \"The Mighty Eye\" about the manufacture of large telescope mirrors and \"Walls of Glass\" about the use of glass as a structural material. The method for setting type was quite different in those days as compared to today. After a story or article was written it was sent to the typesetter. The machine that created the type was called a \"Linotype\". As the operator depressed the keyboard for each letter a brass mold (matrix) for that letter dropped into place until all the molds for one line of type were in place with the spaces between words automatically adjusted so the line was justified to the full width of the column. Then lead which had been heated to 535 degrees was injected into the mold to cast the letters for that line. The lead cooled very rapidly and then was ejected into a tray called a \"stick\". This process was repeated for each line until the entire story was completed. The cast type was then inked with a roller and a strip of paper pressed against it to print what was called a galley proof. One job that every staff member was assigned was to proof read the galley proofs for errors in spelling, punctuation, context, etc. When an error was found it would be marked and initialed by the staff member who made the correction. After each staff member finished reading the galley they signed their name at the bottom of the galley in the order read. It was always a challenge to find an error that one of the other proofreaders had missed, especially if it was a senior staff member. Some of us became proficient enough to just scan a galley and pick out many errors without really reading it. The goofs just seemed to pop out of the page. The corrected galley proofs were then resubmitted to the typesetter for the final casting. Large letters for the story titles were cast by a \"Monotype\" machine which cast one letter at a time. We had several major editorial staff meeting each month. One was to decide on the makeup of the next month's issue and to make assignments for each editorial department. The next was to proof read the galleys and go over the advertisements. The third was to do the page layouts and decide where everything was to go including the ads. This was a cut and paste operation where we cut the galley proofs and arranged them on the page along with the titles and pictures. Finally the lead type, titles and halftone picture plates were arranged in page sized trays and page proofs were printed and checked over. That was kind of the routine. Now I'll go onto other subjects until my senior year when I became Editor of the Iowa Engineer magazine. Military ROT C In my first year at Iowa State my other major activity was enrolling in ROTC the Reserve Officer Training program. There were two divisions, the Field Artillery and the Corps of Engineers. I enrolled in the Corps of Engineers. First we had to learn the basics of military including discipline, close order drill and the use and care of firearms. Eventually I became part of our crack drill team which put on demonstrations at major college events such as Veishea. We practiced and demonstrated such things as the silent drill where we would go through a series of complex maneuvers without any order from our platoon leader. We also did the Queen Ann's manual where we would twirl our rifles and go through all of the complex rifle maneuvers.. Often we would practice close order drill on the polo field rather than in the armory. While doing this one day we were given the command to order arms which meant taking the rifle from our shoulder and setting the rifle butt on the ground next to our right leg. When I did this I heard and felt a squish as I set the rifle down. Although we were required to keep a straight face and eyes forward at all times, I heard some heavy snickering behind me. Then we were given the order for right shoulder arms. It was then that I realized that I had set my rifle butt squarely onto a fresh horse dropping. There was an extra curricular corps of engineers organization called the \"Pontoniers\" . I was on a team such as the three man machine gun squad where we practiced disassembling a machine gun, getting the parts over a 9 foot wall and then setting it up and firing it. We worked against time and later competed against othe schools and usually won first place. One time we traveled to lowa City and competed against the University of Iowa military engineers by rowing and racing bridge pontoons on the lowa River. We also raced little foot bridge pontoons which could barely hold one man. It was difficult because the things were square and kept going in circles unless the paddle was switched from one side to the other after each stroke. The other military group at Iowa State was the field artillery. At that time they were equipped with old W.W.1 French 75 cannons and caissons which were drawn by a team of horses. Because of having the horses Iowa State College also had a polo team which competed with other schools. The field artillery department also had a crack drill team which did fancy maneuvers on horseback and while pulling their cannons and caissons. They would also form human pyramids on the back of three horses trotting side by side. One time I decided to try out for that drill team. One of the first things we had to demonstrate was that we could run from behind the horse and vault onto its bare back. I flunked out on that one right away because I kind of missed the horse and stuck on knee right into its behind. One day, as we were walking to class across the central campus, we discovered that the lawn had been heavily fertilized around the campanile. A huge sign had been erected on the fertilized area which said \"Donated by the Military Department and spread by the English Department\".\n\nPHYSICAL EDUCATION \n\nPhys. Ed. was required of all students. The three major Phys. Ed. Sports I signed up for over the years were golf, swimming and bowling. W could only take on Phys. Ed. Sport in any one quarter. My favorite was golf. lowa State had a gorgeous and scenic 18 hole golf course with some pretty challenging water hazards and bunkers. To get from the first green to the second tee we had to walk through a narrow tunnel under the railroad tracks. The 18th tee happened to be right next to the first green. One day we saw a girl who thought the 18* tee was the second tee and was trying to drive her golf ball through the tunnel. For the sake of anyone walking through the tunnel from the other direction we called her mistake to her attention. To digress here for a minute I'd like to explain something about my social life. Sometime in 1940 I decided that it was unfair to Jane to continue our long distance relationship. There were so many things and experiences that we couldn't share together that we kind of lived in two different worlds. If it had been practical at the time we would have gotten married and shared these college years but it wasn't possible so we parted ways, still good friends. Now back to Phys. Ed. One year I took swimming for PE. Because of work on the lowa Engineer magazine I skipped a few of my swimming classes. Now PE is required so at the end of the quarter I hadn't satisfied the required hours. This was about to hold up my grades for that quarter. Coach Munger informed me that I was behind 8 hours of swimming. With only two days left to the end of the quarter he made me spend 4 hours each day in the pool making up for my lost time. Most of the time I just paddled around the pool with a paddle board but he saw to it that I spent my time in the pool. I felt lake a shriveled raisin when I finally completed the 8 hours. I really enjoyed bowling for PE. The bowling alleys, about eight of them, were located in the basement of the Memorial Union building. In those days the pins were manually set after each frame by pin boys. My scores were about average with maybe an occasional 175 game. One morning I had just bowled a rare, for me, three strikes in a row on my first three frames when the PE instructor came over with some pointed criticism of my bowling style. Then he glanced at the score sheet and saw the three strikes in a row and asked who they belonged to. I proudly told him they were mine. Then he said for me to just ignore his criticism. In the fall of 1942 lowa State College inaugurated one of the largest college physical education programs ever undertaken in the United States. Every male student was subjected to three hours of physical education each week. This included calisthenics, cross - country running, touch football and obstacle course racing. An obstacle course was built patterned after the navy's pre- flight obstacle courses. All of this was in addition to our regular Phys. Ed. Activities. Of course all of this was precipitated by the onset of W.W. II and the need for better physical fitness in waging the war. Most of ;the time we changed into sweat suits and put on running shoes before tackling the cross country obstacle course. I just noticed, in the picture below, that the fellow are wearing long sleeve classroom clothes and dress shoes. They can't make it very far that way. \n\nMOTHER & DAD MOVE TO AMES \n\nSince Dad's (Art Holt's) business travels took him all over the state of Iowa and he spent only one day each week in the Des Moines office, Mother and Dad decided to move to Ames in the fall of 1940. We all figured that this would cut down on college expenses - room and board - if I could live at home. They found and bought a cute little house at 2329 Storm Street which is out in the College end of town. In fact Storm Street, which ran east and west, was the most southern street in the College part of town. From there on south was just farmland. The house had two bedrooms and a bath upstairs ad a third bedroom and bath on the first floor. Mother and Dad had one upstairs bedroom and Marcia the other. The downstairs one was available to Barbara when she was home but at that time she was enrolled in Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin so we didn't see her except during beaks or the summer. I continued active participation in Phi Gam activities but lived at home. This provided several advantages. The Phi Gam house, which couldn't accommodate all of the members and pledges, welcomed the extra bed and study room. For me the advantage was that I had the use of mother's car when I needed it. In addition, Dad said I could fix up the basement into two rooms with double bunks and study desks and rent them out to other college students. The basement also had an enclosed toilet, wash basin and shower. My responsibility was to keep the rooms neat and clean in exchange for the proceeds which I used for college expenses. I ended up using one of the basement rooms and renting out the other. Dad and I built a doghouse for Smokey who lived outdoors, year round. We set the doghouse next to the garage for wind shelter and provided padding and insulation to keep Smokey comfortable although his English Sheep dog fur probably would have sufficed. It wasn't long before I discovered that a family named Wilson, who lived around the corner from us, had the only other English Sheep dog in town. The way I found out was when I took Smokey on a walk to explore the neighborhood and the two dogs met face to face. Then there was suddenly one big ball of flying fur as the two dogs went at each other. I couldn't even tell where on dog left off and the other began or which one to try to pull loose from the fray. It must have ended in a draw because from that day on when the two dogs came within sight of each other they would pass on opposite sides of the street. The family that owned the other English Sheep dog had three children, two my age, who were Betty and Bob Wilson. Their father, Clare Wilson, was in the insurance business so knew Dad quite well and he and his wife Neva became good friends of mother and dad's. I also dated Betty several times. One morning I set Smokey's food dish out by the garage and gave him a whistle. It was then that I saw him galloping, pell mell, from the neighbor's yard and heading to come through the bushes beside our driveway. Dad had parked his car right where Smokey would come sailing through the bushes. Too late to stop him I watched Smokey sail through those bushes into the side of Dad's car, knocking himself silly and putting a small dent in Dad's door. Smokey did recover ok after a few minutes of immobility. When I'd take Smokey for a walk, he developed the habit of finding a nice flat rock, backing up to it and leaving his calling card on the rock which marked a neighbor's driveway entrance. It became a visible eye sore. I finally broke him of this habit since I always had to go home, get a shovel and paper and clean up after him. The first winter we were in Ames, Mother and Dad drove to Des Moines one Saturday for some social event connected with his company. While they were gone, it started to snow and snow and snow all afternoon and that night. In fact it snowed so much that Ames made the centerfold in Life Magazine showing cars completely gone under the snow. Nothing, but nothing moved for three days before digging out was completed. Marcia and I had enough food in the house to take care of ourselves. We dug out Smokey's doghouse which was buried under several feet of snow or he might have suffocated. I had some cross-country skis and so did Betty Wilson so we skied our way to the theater on Lincolnway which ran movies for those who could get there. The lobby was the depository for lots of skis and snowshoes of the people who did make it to the theater. Marcia was enrolled into a nearby grade school but I don't remember the name. Mother became a Campfire Girl leader with Marcia in her troop. In Des Moines, mother had been a Girl Scout leader so Marcia got an exposure to both organizations. Mother always loved gardening so planted a beautiful flower garden behind our house. Someday maybe I'll find a picture of it. The lot next door to us was bought up by D. Gilkey, who lived directly behind us. He bought the lot to keep it vacant for a place for his boys and neighborhood kids to play. Dr. Gilkey, who was head of the Theoretical and Applied Mechanics Department, had two sons, Art and Herb. Art used to work his trained hawks in the vacant lot. Later Art was killed while mountain climbing in the far east. Herb and I were the same age and later both were involved in the heating and air conditioning field. Dr. Gilkey was one of my professors. Around the corner from us were the Fred Lorch's. He was head of the English Department. Mother and Dad became close friends of the Lorches and continued the friendship even after mother and dad returned to Des Moines. I think it was in 1942 when I finally took on a roommate at home. His name was Paul Weill. Paul's father had owned four department stores in Germany during the pre-Hitler period. However, because they were Jewish, they could not take any assets out of the country after Hitler came into power. So they sent Paul to high school in Switzerland where he was safe and could also charge things to his father's accounts in Germany. From Paul's stories he really lived high on the hog in Switzerland. About the time of Paul's high school graduation things started to get real bad in Germany for Jewish families. Paul's parents made it out of Germany in the nick of time and came to the United States. Paul followed a short time later and enrolled at Iowa State College in engineering. Paul spoke six languages fluently but as we studied he would think and mutter in German. His English accent was very much like Henry Kissinger's and the girls kind of went ga-ga over it. He also had a great sense of humor. In fact he said that Germany was bound to lose the war because they didn't have a sense of humor and took things too seriously. One afternoon Paul and I were playing chess in the Memorial Union cafeteria. He always beat me at chess except this one time. A group of girls gathered around us to watch the game. Paul became distracted but I kept my composure and was able to checkmate him. I told Paul that now having won I planned to give up chess while I was ahead. One quarter, Paul decided to get some easy credits so he signed up for a German language course. The professor booted him out of the class when he discovered that Paul grew up in Germany and spoke the language more fluently than the professor. Sometime in the fall of 1942 Paul decided to enlist in the U.S. army. Since he was not a citizen yet, they could not give him a commission but they did need his language skills. When he went into the service he had to turn in his collection of valuable cameras and regretted not having just given them to me instead. Later he was trained as a Link Trainer instructor and finally sent to Germany at the end of the war where he served in the office of Military Government and in the process was instrumental in unearthing Goering's collection of art treasures. While there he got his U.S. citizenship. Then he met a girl named Helga who was one of only 20 who survived one of Hitlter's death camps. But then, being a U.S. citizen, he was forbidden to fraternize with Germans. Finally, through a special dispensation from either the congress or the President, he was allowed to marry Helga. Finally he brought her to this country and re-enrolled at Iowa State University. Paul was one of Mother's favorite people. This may have been in part because he reminded her of another of her close German friends, Dr. Max Pinner. Remember them from the time Mother traveled with Max and Behrna to Tucson when I was still quite young? I had described their trip earlier in my Remembrances. Paul gave Mother a beautiful set of crystal horse bookends and remained in touch with her even after he set up his import/export company in New York City after graduating from Ames following W.W. II. Another friend I made sometime in 1940 was Bob Nelson. Bob was built like and looked kind of like a bulldog. He had served in the merchant marine for three years while he was earning enough money to go to college. Bob told me about the shiploads of scrap iron that were being sent to Japan. One day he said \"You know, Graydon, one of these days all of that scrap iron is going to come back to us in the form of bullets\". How right he was. One evening Bob and I had a double date. I hadn't showered or shaved so stopped by his apartment to get cleaned up. Since I didn't have my safety razor with me, he offered to let me use his straight razor. I had an awful time with it and came through with two or three good nicks and patches. I asked Bob how in the world he could shave with one of those lethal weapons on a rolling ship. He said you just learn to roll with the ship or wait until the seas are calm. Back to the house on Storm Street. One day Mother decided to put up some preserves. She heated wax to seal the preserves in a jar. Somehow she accidently dumped the hot wax into the sink full of water. The whole thing exploded when it hit the water and splattered over the kitchen walls and curtains setting them on fire. Marcia was upstairs so when she called the fire department she also said something about getting her little girl out of the house. Well the fire department got there in record time. It just so happened that Waldo McDowell, Dad's insurance agent, was just down the street at a party. When the fire engines arrived so did Waldo. After the fire was out he made an assessment of the damage, arranged for a contractor to come in and told mother that when Dad returned from his business trip two days later Dad wouldn't know that anything had happened. Mother did tell him though. One day, a girl that I had dated, told me that she had a practical test coming up in foods and nutrition lab so she wanted to get in a little practice. I told her to come on over to the house and practice her recipe there. After she was done cooking up a storm, half of mother's pots and pans seemed to have been used. It was probably my fault that we then took off for some kind of college event. When Dad came home and saw the mess and I told him how it had occurred he exclaimed \"Good lord, don't they give these girls a course in dishwashing before their senior year?\" SUMMER WORK During college breaks and the summer months I generally found work to earn some cash for the next year's expenses For during the midyear break periods I did land a job in the Iowa State College farm statistics research department. Farmers who wished to participate in the program submitted their accounting books to the department which built up data on farm income, expenses, etc. They kept track of what the farmers bought and sold in the way of crops and produce and how much they withheld for their own use. My job was to do all of the calculating from the farmer's books and develop breakdowns and spreadsheets for statistical analysis. The machine I used for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division was called a comptometer. It was simply a mechanical version of today's calculator. Each time a key was pressed it rotated one of the number dials to the next position. I got pretty good on that machine. During the summer months, I wanted a job more related to engineering. Since the Iowa State Highway Commission offices were located in Ames, I applied for a job there. I had to fill out an application and also provide a sample of my printing. After the application was okayed I was asked one final question. What political party did belong to? I told them that I was a Republican which must have been the correct answer since I got the job. My duties were to serve as payroll clerk in the resident engineer's office in Jefferson, Iowa about 50 miles west of Ames on Highway 30. My boss was the resident engineer named Dick Raver. He was just a peach of a guy and immediately took me under his wing. In fact the payroll work didn't take much of my time so I had the opportunity to get out on the highway construction sites and learn all about that part of the business. The first summer on the job they were building a highway where none had been before. This involved purchasing the right-of-way, which was Dick Raver's expertise, then surveying it and setting out the stakes for the centerline, shoulders, etc. We had one specialized guy that would set dynamite to blow tree stumps and even some entire trees to clear the right-of-way. He would set the charge, figure the fuse length, light the fuse and move on to the next stump or tree, keeping ahead of the succession of blast by just the right margin of safety. Then before any earthmoving equipment moved in, the survey crew had to survey a cross-section of the planned roadway every fifty feet. Then after the earth had been moved for cuts and fills and the grading completed, another cross-section survey was done. On rainy days we would plot these before and after cross- sections and with a planimeter measure how many cubic yards of dirt had been moved over each distance of 50 feet. The machinery trucking operators who hauled the dirt in and out were then paid on the basis of the amount of dirt hauled Since I spent all week in Jefferson, I rented a room in a private home and had the use of cooking facilities. Then on weekend I'd hitchhike back to Ames for some more nourishing and tasty meals at home.. ACADEMICS Because of work, social activities and the Iowa Engineer magazine my grades were just average. They ranged between A and C with an average of B or B-. Once in a while I'd have a flash of pure genius and come up with an A+. One of my favorite subjects was Kinematics which is the study of mechanical motion where we designed linkages that did neat things. It was pure logic. Also I enjoyed strength of materials and structures because they stood still while I worked on them or contemplated changing them. Now, electricity I always had trouble with because it not only didn't stand still but you couldn't see it. In regard to electricity, direct current made some sense to me because it travelled in only one direction and always seemed to know where it wanted to go. Alternating current didn't make any sense at all because it just kept going back and forth and I never could figure out how it ever got anywhere. Chemistry was a little like electricity. I could see water for instance but never could see pure oxygen or pure hydrogen which were real light, invisible and dry and how they could get together and make something heavy and wet like water was beyond me. I did have less trouble with inorganic chemistry than I did with organic chemistry. The organic molecules were just too big and complex for me to understand and there was no way I could predict what would happen when two of them got together. Eventually I did become somewhat of an expert on the burning of natural gas and fuel oil because only three elements were really involved - Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen. But that's as far as my chemistry went. For some strange reason I never did have much trouble with thermodynamics or heat transfer even though I couldn't see heat or cold but I sure could feel them. I understood why things expand when they get hot because the molecules want to get somewhere else. I did have a little trouble with the Technical Journalism course. The problem was that I skipped too many classes while I was editing two technical publications, the Iowa Engineer magazine and the Aeronautical Engineering department paper, the Fly Paper. I thought I'd at least get some consideration for my outside technical journalism efforts but my professor said that wasn't my classroom assignment so gave me a C. Oh well, it's what I learned and the practical experience I had gained that really counted more the grade - or so I tell myself. The laboratory courses were my favorites. I just loved the hands-on experiences which gave more meaning to the classroom academics. In one lab class we learned how to make sand molds for iron castings. Then we learned foundry practices by melting iron and pouring it into the mold to make a gear blank. In the following course we machined the gear blank that we had cast and our final test was to have the gear mesh perfectly with the main gear that the instructor had made. Hydraulics and Aerodynamics courses were especially fun because we got to experiment with water flow and work in the wind tunnel testing and observing the effects of air flow over wing surfaces and complete model airplanes which we had designed and built. The only lab I had trouble with was fuels and combustion which was run by the Mechanical Engineering Department. The trouble was that we Aeronautical Engineers couldn't figure out what good that would do to power an airplane. I repeated the course after the war when the emphasis was on liquid fuels including aviation fuels. We had our wind tunnel lab course and lectures in the rear of the Aero E. building. The lab included radial engines mounted on test stands and a complete Navy aircraft carrier airplane which has wings that folded upwards when stored below the carrier flight deck. Our plane had one wing up and the other wing down in flight position. During the lab classes my desk was directly under the wing that was down. I'd get so engrossed in the lesson and lecture that when it was over I'd rise out of my seat and jam my head into the bottom of that wing. This happened time after time and kind of became a joke to everyone but me. Well, so much for academics. AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING Sometime in 1940 Aeronautical Engineering was separated from the Mechanical Engineering department and made into a department of its own. About that time someone suggested that we start a monthly department paper. I ended up with the job and named our four page paper the Fly Paper. We published it for a few months and then I got so busy with other things I had to turn it over to someone else. Someone else never stepped forward so the paper kind of died out. The head of the new Aeronautical Engineering department was Professor Wilbur Nelson. He was in the process of writing a textbook on propeller design. Another student and I worked with him doing some of the diagrams and drawings for the book which was later published in 1944. Initially the department was quite small and our resources were limited. Often if we needed something we would either have to scrounge it or build it ourselves. The first major item was a 100 mph closed loop wind tunnel. We students did much of the work to build the wind tunnel on our own time without academic credit but the experience was invaluable. On the next page is a picture of the entire Aeronautical Engineering department. In the front row is Dr. Nelson, fourth from left, and Professor John Coan, at the left. Professor Coan taught us aircraft structures among other subjects. He had worked for Boeing until health required him to return to the academic world. He had a habit of throwing structures problems at us which he had encountered at Boeing Aircraft to see how WE would have solved it. This made the subject very interesting and challenging. He was also a stickler for preciseness and accuracy. He said \"However you arrive at it — the most important thing is to come up with the correct answer — that's all the airplane cares about.\" One day Coan gave us a one problem test on a wing structure. It took about five minutes to set up the equations and about two hours of calculations, with a slide rule, to solve the problem. I got my paper back with the notation \"Your method is perfect - you made a silly error in your calculations - this aircraft failed on takeoff - shame on you - Zero\". Sometimes Professor Coan would interrupt his lecture and expound on a totally unrelated, but intriguing subject such as the subject of King Henry and what happened to his eight wives. He would pick the brains of whomever he met and became a walking encyclopedia in humanities, art, agriculture, you name it. Being single he would invite interesting Home Economics lady professors out to lunch and learn all about gourmet cooking or textiles. I double dated with him several times and found that he had a terrific sense of humor and could keep us laughing most of the evening. T. A. Wilson, who was a graduate student in our class (not present when this picture was taken) later became President and then CEO of Boeing. It was during his presidency that the 747 was developed and then manufactured. Just this year, on the 50th anniversary of our Aero E. class of 1943, an honorary doctorate was conferred on T. Wilson. We were all shocked to hear of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Immediately thereafter the aircraft industry shifted into high gear. Because of the sudden demand for trained personnel, Curtiss Wright screened 711 college women to take an accelerated course in Aeronautics Engineering with an emphasis on aircraft structure and aircraft manufacturing. Ninety seven of these women were sent to lowa State College and dumped into our department of 33 men. We were overwhelmed to say the least. CURTISS WRIGHT CADETTES Women engineers, at that time, were a novelty and women in the aeronautical engineering field were almost unheard of. The exception were women pilots such as Amelia Earhardt. The women who were enrolled in Aeronautical Engineering by the Curtiss Wright Aircraft Company were called Curtiss Wright Cadettes. They had previously majored in such subjects that ranged from dietetics to psychology or art to chemistry. These women were housed in the Iowa State Memorial Union. When I became Editor of the Iowa Engineer magazine I began losing senior staff members to the armed services. In search of replacements I surveyed the Curtis Wright Cadettes for any of the women who had any journalism experience. Several of them stepped forward but one in particular, Marjorie Allen, had enough that I appointed her to the staff in the position of Associate Editor and assigned her to write a feature article about the Curtis Wright Cadettes which was featured in our April, 1943 issue. With permission, I've reprinted the article as an addendum at the end of my Remembrances so will not go into more detail about the Cadettes at this time. As the result of my work on the lowa Engineer magazine I was elected to serve on the Engineering Council. This is the council made up of student representatives from each of the engineering departments and engineering professional organizations. At the beginning of my senior year I was given the choice of running for president of the Engineering Council or for Engineering Council representative to the student governing council \"Cardinal Guild\". Cardinal Guild was made up of representatives from each of the major college divisions such as Veterinary, Home Economics, Science, Inter fraternity Council, etc. This group set the rules and policies for all students and organizations on the campus. I chose to run for \"Cardinal Guild Another fellow who was running for Engineering Council president offered to throw his support and backing for me if I would support his campaign. As the result we were both elected to our respective offices. While I served on Cardinal Guild we decided to establish an activity point system. This was to prevent too few people from dominating too many of the activities and sometimes at the expense of their academic performance. So we assigned a point value to each activity and office. This included sports, publications, organizational membership and much more. Then we limited the total number of points any one person could carry. It was quite generous. Then we discovered that most of us on Cardinal Guild exceeded the maximum point limit so we inserted a grandfather clause which allowed us to each continue with our current activities. Because of my activities I was awarded the Iowa State University \"I\" key two years in a row. In addition I was inducted into the engineering honorary \"Knights of St. Patrick\". ' St. Patrick is the patron saint of engineers. During the ceremony, which was held during Veishea, each of the inductees kissed the Blarney Stone and was dubbed a knight with a slide rule scepter. See pictures. Each of us was presented with a beautiful key with a green inlaid shamrock with a slide rule across it. See picture. Every year the Knights of St. Patrick put on the Engineer's Ball and elected an Engineer's Lady Entrance into Uncle Sam's Army I was close to graduating but found out about an Air Force Engineering Cadet program that would send me to MIT, all expenses paid, to finish out for my degree and give me a commission. Some fellows did that and ended up as liaison officers with aircraft manufacturers and then good jobs with the same manufacturer after the war ended. By that time my old room mate Kirk Bennett who had already gone into the army with a direct commission had come back to lowa State University for a visit. When he learned of my plans he said \"Graydon, I wish I had taken basic training before getting my commission\". So I figured I'd sign up for enlisted service, get my basic training and then move on from there into the Engineering Cadet program at MIT. It didn't exactly work out that way. The quickest, simplest and easiest way to get into service at that time was to volunteer. Kirk Bennett's dad, Colonel Bennett, arranged for a letter of recommendation from Iowa State Adjutant General, General Grahl to assign me to an air force base for my basic training. Then I figured I'd be in a good position to go from there toward a commission in the air force and then onto an eastern college such as MIT to complete the work for my Aero E. degree. Others who went this route were then assigned by the air force as liaison officers with aircraft companies such as Boeing, Glenn L. Martin, Curtiss Wright, etc. My first step was to sign up for what was called \"voluntary induction\". Then things moved rather rapidly and I soon received my notice to report to Camp Dodge, which was the induction center just north of Des Moines. This was the spring of 1943, sometime in May. At the time I was still in classes but in my excitement to get started I neglected to tell the school and my various instructors that I was dropping out of classes to enter the services. As the result, I later learned that I got all F's for the courses I was taking that quarter. After the war I came back and made up those classes and graduated. When the day came to report for induction, a bus toured our area of lowa picking up the new draftees, recruit and volunteers such as I. It then delivered us to Camp Dodge. We all arrived in our civilian clothes and were lined up and given a briefing about the procedures to follow then and the next day and finally to be assigned to barracks and our bunks for that night. The next morning we were called into formation, which was kind of sloppy since we really hadn't yet learned how to line up real good or stand at attention properly, at least the other guys didn't but I did since I'd had ROTC in college. We were then marched to the mess hall for breakfast and then back to another formation. At that time the sergeant asked if any of us could type. Two of us raised our hands thinking we'd really get a good start in the army and a soft assignment to boot. He told us to go to the supply sergeant and request a couple of Irish typewriters. So we marched off, pretty proud of ourselves, approached the supply sergeant and submitted our request. He kind of smiled and rolled out two lawn mowers and told us where the grass needed cutting. That was the last time I volunteered while in the army. The next day we were administered the oath about defending our country and then lined up to receive our army uniforms, boots, etc. We then sent our civilian clothes back home and were never again out of uniform for the rest of the war. Dog tags were also stamped and issued to each of us. At that time our two dog tags were stamped with the army serial number which had been assigned to us, our name and parent's name and address. We were required to wear the dog tags on a necklace at all times so in case of emergency or death we could be identified and next of kin notified. The next week or so consisted of interviews and processing as well as various duties and drills to keep us occupied. We even had some time for recreation and swimming in the Camp Dodge swimming pool so army life, so far, wasn't all that bad. Bit by bitt some were shipped off to various branches of the service and army posts for basic training. Finally my time came and three or four of us were shipped off to Lincoln Air Base in Lincoln, Nebraska. It was a good assignment and close to home. Besides being a B24 bomber crew staging base, a glider pilot training base and a school for aircraft mechanics, Lincoln Air Base was also a basic training center for all enlisted air force personnel. It's location was just outside Lincoln, Nebraska which is also the capitol of Nebraska and a good liberty town for off duty servicemen. Basic Training Because of the closeness of Lincoln we were transported by bus from Camp Dodge. On our arrival we were kind of split up and assigned to various Flights for eight weeks of basic training. In the Air Corps a Flight was, and may still be, the equivalent of a Platoon in the Army. To the best of my recollection our Flight was number 28. Each Flight was housed in a one story barracks and was commanded by a drill corporal. I can't remember the name of our corporal but he was a little guy and quite a character whom we all got to like even when he gave us hell. The first thing we had to learn was to make up our bunk so a quarter would bounce off the blanket. We had a foot locker at the foot of the bunk which held our uniform clothing and personal belongings. In front of the foot locker were our extra pair of boots which had to be properly laced and clean. Inspections by our Flight leader base officers were frequent and thorough and everything had to be spit and polish. Our corporal was also judged during some of these inspections which gave him an incentive to ride herd on us. At first we had heard and thought that Air Force basic training would be a breeze, unlike infantry basic which got down to earth and dirty. How wrong we were. The Air Corps had learned in combat that often Air Force personnel ended up on the front lines and were ill prepared for the kind of combat that faced the infantry. So starting about the time we arrived at Lincoln Air Base the Air corps assigned infantry officers to oversee our basic training. What made matters worse was that the infantry officers had no love for the Air Forces and vice versa. So they really poured it to us. I forgot how many hours of calisthenics we were subjected to each day but I think it was one hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon. Then we had the obstacle course to say nothing of close order drill. Wherever we went we marched in formation of three columns side by side. As we marched we had a right guide and guidon flag bearer carrying out Flight 28 flag. Another soldier about my height was assigned as guidon bearer and I became the right guide who set the pace for the rest of the flight behind us to follow. He and I marched side by side at the head of the column. One day, while we were marching, our corporal signaled to the Flight behind us to slow down without the two of us up front realizing what was going on. As the two of us marched on to the cadence of hut-two-three-foe we noticed bystanders starting to grin and even laugh. We also became aware that there no longer were footsteps behind us. It was then we glanced behind us, which is strictly forbidden, and discovered that we two were up there marching all alone and the rest of the Flight was about a half block behind us. Another thing our corporal did once in a while was to give us orders or count cadence in Donald Duck language and he made us try to keep a straight face. Guess he was trying to teach us discipline under adverse conditions. Between some calisthenics, drill and field exercises we would sometimes get a few minutes break in the barracks. We didn't dare mess up our bunks so some of us simply laid down on the wooden floor, rested our heads in our plastic helmet liners and went sound to sleep. At other times we could go to the PX (Post Exchange) and buy some goodies or refreshments. I remember sometimes buying a whole quart of milk and drinking it in one sitting. Whenever we marched in formation we often sang songs in unison. In fact the various Flights competed in their singing ability. Some of our favorites were \"Wait 'till the Sun Shines, Nellie\". ', \"Beer Barrel Polka\", \"Be Kind to Your Web Footed Friends Because A Duck May Be Somebody's Mother\", \"The Whiffenpoof Song\" and many others. Once in a while we'd all sit out on the drill field and a truck bearing a full band would show up to lead us on in song. It included a piano and full brass section. So basic training did have some of its lighter moments. There were classroom sessions where we were taught some real technical stuff like which end of the gun the bullet comes out of. Seriously we had to learn to field strip and old WWI Springfield or Enfield rifle and reassemble it, how to clean it, care for it and how to use it. There were also classes about aircraft and both U.S. and enemy aircraft identification. The instructor used flash cards to show the profiles of various aircraft from below, the side or head on. We had to learn to identify each aircraft immediately so, in the future, we wouldn't shoot down one of our own. One of the identifying features was the aircraft's dihedral, which is the upward slope of the wings. One student asked the instructing sergeant why an airplane had dihedral. The instructor paused and thought for a few seconds and then said it was to \"help split the wind\". I came within a hair's breath of correcting him and explaining the purpose but bit my tongue and kept my mouth shut in the name of good military politics. Besides I'd already learned not to volunteer which included not opening my mouth. In the field we were trained in hand-to-hand combat both with our bare hands and with our rifle (we were trained to call it a \"piece\"). During one of the training sessions we were lined up in two columns. We were paired off with our adversary who was the guy next to us in the other column. Then we spread out over the field for an exercise in hand-to-hand combat. The trouble for me was that my partner was an ex-college boxer. We did reach a gentlemen's agreement that when it was my turn to throw him or disarm him he'd cooperate, somewhat, but when it came time for him to do the same to me I had to put up a fight to provide him with a challenge. During the disarming session he tried to twist my rifle out of my hand. I successfully resisted by swinging the butt down but then brought the butt of it up between my legs and nearly split myself in two. Boy how that hurt and I was kind of disabled for the rest of the exercise. He was kind of disabled with laughter but then took pity on me. After that we became good friends. Occasionally we got a pass to go into Lincoln. My newfound friend (I can't remember his name) and I would visit the local USO where we met a gal who once invited us over to her house for supper. We also made a tour of the local points of interest including the Nebraska state capitol. Since we were the only two visitors during our tour of the capitol we really got the royal treatment and learned all about their unicameral legislature. Also we met the governor. I guess not that many servicemen were interested in visiting the state capitol since when they got in town they were thinking more about girls. Completion of Basic Training After eight weeks of intensive physical training we were graduated from basic training, given an Air Corps shoulder patch and PFC stripe and prepared for our next assignment. This meant being subjected to a battery of tests and interviews. There were both intelligence tests and manual dexterity tests. One series of tests required us to take a pile of parts, figure out how they went together and properly assembling them. I think there were ten or twelve different piles of junk. As I finished assembling one of them I moved on to the next. The objective was to both assemble the pieces correctly and do it against the clock. Later I was told that I had run the course in a new record time. Also I was told that I had scored over 140 on the intelligence test though I never found out my exact score. When the tests were completed I was interviewed by both an army officer and a university professor at the same time. After looking at my college credentials the army officer asked me in a sarcastic tone what was the Knights of St. Patrick. Before I could answer him, the college professor lit into him explaining that it was an engineering honorary society. Those two guys just didn't get along very well and there I was in-between. I felt that the Prof. was sticking up for my interests more than the army officer. As it turned out, I was offered the choice of going to AM (Aircraft Mechanics) school or to a university to get some more engineering education. I think the Prof. was trying to sell me on college and the army officer was trying to sell me on AM school. When I mentioned that I wanted to participate in the MIT Engineering Cadet program they informed me that it had been suspended about three weeks before. So I opted for the college figuring that the cadet program might open up again at a later date. I've sometimes wondered what would have happened had I chose the other AM option. Having made my decision, I was turned over to the University of Nebraska for processing to another university into what was termed the Army Specialized Training Program referred to as ASTP. It took two or three more weeks to finally process my records. In the meantime I spent most of my time in lecture halls and study halls. After being physically conditioned for eight weeks in basic training I could hardly sit still for more than ten minutes. It was murder since I felt like a hyperactive kid. I spent a lot of time back and forth to the drinking fountain and men's room just to get the exercise en-route. Finally, I was informed that I would be sent to the University of West Virginia in Morgantown, West Virginia. I'd been pretty good at geography but I must admit that I couldn't remember a state named West Virginia, much less where it was located. So I dug out an atlas in the library and located the state and the town of Morgantown. Next, I was informed that I would be one of the group leaders which were required for each contingency of men going to each of a number of universities. So I was to go into training to learn how to lead and supervise a group of soldiers being posted to the University of West Virginia. Since each of the groups were traveling by train we were instructed on how to keep track of the men, see that they were fed and assemble them and call roll after each train stop. OFF TO WEST VIRGINIA The day of departure arrived and each of the group leaders was put in charge of his group of men. When my turn came I inquired as to where my group was. I was then informed that I was the only soldier going from Lincoln to the University of West Virginia. In other words I was both the leader of my group and I was the group. At the time I thought how silly it would look for me to call myself to attention on a railroad platform and call roll and then answer myself \"Here\" ?. I must say that I was tempted to do just that. The train trip to Morgantown was by coach and required two train changes, one in Chicago and the second in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. These weren't troop trains but rather civilian trains. There were, however, quite a few service men and women traveling on them from one assignment to the next or on leave or furlough. Sometimes the coaches were un-crowded and even double seats available to stretch out on for a nap. However from Chicago eastward the cars became more crowded until finally, one night some of we servicemen were sleeping in the aisles having given up our seats to the ladies. Fortunately the trains stopped occasionally and I had time to stretch my legs and get some refreshments before the next \"All Aboard!!\" call. The train from Pittsburgh traveled through the mountains of Pennsylvania and West Virginia along the Monongahela River, which flowed from the Ohio River in Pittsburgh south through Morgantown. The rail line ran along the river at the bottom of the canyons. I never saw such a dirty river. It was kind of a brown and copper color and totally opaque. I don't see how the fish could see their way around, if in fact there were fish in there. Apparently there were a lot of industrial discharges into the river. It was morning when the train rolled to a stop at the little railroad station in Morgantown. I was the only soldier that got off at that stop. When I did, someone said in a loud voice \"You'll be sorry!!\". I was then met at the station by a Lieutenant and his driver who drove me to my dormitory on the University of West Virginia campus. I was instructed to take my duffel bag to my room which had been assigned and then to report to the ASTP office across the street. The dormitory building was a huge brick structure about four stories high. It was also virtually empty. I found my room, took a shower to get rid of the railroad dust and soot and then reported to the office. I was informed that I was the first soldier to arrive, that more would be coming in later and that I was to be acting First Sergeant of what was termed a provisional company until the men could be assigned to their proper classes and the start of school training. My duties were to meet the incoming men at the train, see that they were transported to the dormitory, assign them their rooms and inform them where to get their linens, etc. I was also to call formations when appropriate, take roll and march the men to the dining hall at meal time. I began to feel like I was assigned to be a wet nurse. The job was pretty easy at first since soldiers from all over the country arrived in lots of threes or fours to a dozen. Then one day a group of about fifty from an infantry basic training camp arrived. Their training had been pretty rough and they really showed it. Also they weren't too happy to be given orders by a guy who was wearing an Air Corps patch on his shoulder. I told them that we were now all in ASTP and volunteered to remove my Air Corps patch. That seemed to make thing better. They were also the first soldiers to arrive who knew how to do close order drill and were a great help when others arrived. In fact I had to break the group up into several platoons as the arrivals increased the company to almost 200 men. Some from that infantry group became my platoon leaders and were a great help. ASTP School Begins When all the soldiers had finally arrived, the provisional company was disbanded and we were broken down into groups by school year and type of courses. The group I was assigned to was the smallest one since all of us had been in our senior year in various engineering schools. There were just four of us. Most of the others were just starting out or had been midway in their education. Because of our small number we were assigned to take over an empty fraternity house on the highest hill overlooking the campus and the town of Morgantown. We had the fraternity house all to ourselves. To reach the fraternity we had to climb a hill which got steeper and steeper until the final leg was by hundreds and hundreds of concrete steps. We had individual beds and study desks in a room s that held up to four men. Our room had a beautiful view overlooking the campus and Morgantown and was equipped with a mini library and phonograph with a fabulous collection of records. We had a hard time believing that this was to be our army for the next few months. In fact we could look down the main street in Morgantown and with a pair of binoculars see what was listed on the movie theater marquee. My roommates were Bowen (Bo) Sterling from the Bronx, New York: Arthur (Art) Stevens from Grand Rapids, Michigan and Don Stultz from New Augusta, Indiana. When we had been assigned our classes, we discovered that at least one of the four men in our room had taken one of the courses in college before. We compared notes and decided each of us would specialize in a subject and do the homework for the other three. Art Stevens had a masters degree in metallurgy so he took on the metallurgy course. I had specialized in hydraulics and fluid mechanics so I took on that one. Don had differential equations and vibration analysis so he took it. Bo had taken kinematics. So each evening after classes we could all sail through our assignments and then go out on the town. By the way, we each varied our answers enough to throw off suspicion by our professors. The specialist in each subject also became the tutor for the other three during review time for exams. What a system. It was especially easy for me since I'd had and passed every subject but one when a student at Iowa State University. In fact kinematics was my favorite subject at Iowa State and I had gotten an At. My professor had written a text on the subject and I still had my text, the lesson plans and my worksheets which I wrote home for. I gave them to my Morgantown instructor and he was so pleased that I got a by for the course and credit for it. Obviously we all were able to have the time to explore the area, go to movies and develop a very active after hour's social life. The campus was interesting with all of its ups and downs. In fact they used to say that the best thing about West Virginia was that if you got tired you could lean against it. It was also said that most West Virginians had one leg shorter than the other from walking around the edge of the mountains. Morgantown's biggest employer was the DuPont Company which had a huge chemical plant just outside of town which made war munitions. Because the emissions from the smoke stacks got trapped in the valley we had to be careful to wipe of the grass before we sat down on it because it was often coated with black sooty stuff. I guess that the many coke ovens in the area didn't help either. I forget how I got tagged with KP (kitchen police) duty one time so it must not have been a serious infraction of the rules. It was the first time I'd ever reported for KP duty so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The first thing in the morning they sent me down to the kitchen at our ASTP dining area. When I reported to the kitchen I discovered that I was the only soldier there. All the rest of the workers in the kitchen and dining room were college home economics girls. Boy, I decided that if this is army punishment I'm all for it. We were all kept pretty busy that day and I think some of the guys kind of envied me. I had heard about the Morgantown Glass Guild where they produced hand blown glass ware. Don and I decided to take a tour of the Guild. They produced beautiful glassware included ruby glass stemware. In one of my letters home I told mother about our tour. About a week later I received a money order with a note to purchase a dozen each of several types of ruby stemware. Mother had been trying to purchase some at Younkers in Des Moines but they told her that the manufacture of ruby glass had been suspended because of the war and the ingredients required to produce ruby glass. There was a USO in town where soldiers could go to relax and meet some of the local girls who served as hostesses. There was also an occasional dance. At one of these dances we had a kind of mixer which I think was called a John Paul Jones. It was at one of the mixers that I met a local girl named Ruth Marie Wilson. Later I had several dates with her for lunch or the movies. One time I got a sty on my left eye and had to wear an eye patch. Ruth and I were having lunch when we over heard someone mention that I must be Morgantown's first war casualty. I also double dated with some of my roommates with other girls. Bo Sterling, who was Jewish dated a Catholic girl named Helen Campenella. It made for some interesting conversations. Bo later married Helen. Since my home was Iowa, I must have bragged about how great our farms were and tried to impress Ruth with my limited knowledge of farms and farming. So one day she invited me to visit her father's home, since her mother was now longer living. As we drove to his place I noticed that she was directing me out of town and into the countryside. Well, it turned out that her father owned a West Virginia farm and was farming it with the help of several of Ruth's brothers. As we pulled up to the house and got out of the car Ruth told me to follow her as she walked toward the barn. Once inside the barn she pointed to a cow and asked me to show her how we milked them in Iowa. Well I had to admit that I couldn't remember whether one pumped the cow's tail up and down or cranked it in a rotary motion to get the milk out. Anyway that's when the whole truth came out that I was a 100 percent city boy. Later Ruth told me that her father said that I'd never be a success as a farmer to which she replied that I had no desire or talent to become one. We were at Morgantown, in ASTP, throughout the winter months and those of us who were in the most senior classes were to complete our courses of study by spring. This time came all too soon since we were enjoying the luxuries of campus army life immensely. At the time of graduation, those of us who were about to graduate from ASTP were called together to inform us about our next military assignment. We were told that the services weren't prepared to receive us into engineering jobs and were presented a list of services available to us. They included Infantry, Chemical Warfare, Armored and Signal Intelligence. We could take our pick the next morning on a first-come-first-served basis. Bo Sterling and I decided that anything with the word \"intelligence\" in it had to be better than the other three choices. Since there were only two slots open in Signal Intelligence Bo and I managed to be the first two in line the next morning and got that assignment. Assignment to Camp Crowder, Missouri We were told that we would be assigned to the 60* Signal Radio Intelligence Company at Camp Crowder, Missouri. Camp Crowder was located near Neosho, Missouri, which became our closest off base hanging-out spot. The train ride there from Morgantown was a repeat of the one from Lincoln, Nebraska only in reverse. The trip consisted of day coach seats and sometimes sleeping in the aisles. Upon our arrival we were bused to a set of one story wooden barracks toward the outskirts of Camp Crowder. Our commanding officer, by the name of Captain Scofield, was introduced to us. We were told that he was a graduate of West Point and had played on their football team. Captain Scofield welcomed us and then informed us that when he gave an order he expected it to be obeyed immediately and without question. That was our introduction to the Signal Corps. Since Bo and I were among the first few arrivals we were subjected to mostly physical training, field marches and infantry- like stuff to pass the time until the company roster was completed. One of the other soldiers in our small beginning group was Eddie Danzinger who was from Boston, Mass. Eddie was a good looking guy with the manners one would expect of Boston gentry. He was also kind of a smooth operator with the girls. Eddie and I became real close friends and buddies that lasted throughout our remaining service years. In fact we kind of looked out after each other to protect against any entangling girl alliances. In other words we did a lot of double dating when on or off the base. Finally our whole company complement was completed. The company consisted of about 250 men and included future radio operators, radio repair technicians, cooks, motor pool mechanics and supply personnel. We were designed to be completely self sufficient in the field and not have to depend on other services for support. This meant that we could be moved as a unit anywhere in the world as our mission might require. Also individual operators could be temporarily assigned to other units and services for specific missions. Ultimately our equipment required transportation in 66 trucks. These included jeeps, weapons carriers, six by six cargo trucks and four semi-trailer trucks. Even many of the radio operators were assigned trucks. I was told to go to the motor pool and pick out a six by six truck. A six by six is a truck with two axels of dual wheels in the rear and six wheel drive. I picked out a GMC six by six truck with a winch on the front. Eddie, who was also a radio operator, became my assistant driver. See the picture. The six by six trucks and semi trailers all were to be crammed with radio equipment. Fifteen or twenty of the six by six's carried a completely enclosed radio shack which had banks of radio receivers, recording equipment, cryptographic equipment and communications. It was said that each three vehicles in our motor pool contained about one million dollars worth of gear. That was a lot of money in those days. My truck was an open stake body type and would carry a disassembled radio direction finder tower and radio and pull a trailer equipped with a 110 bolt generator. When our company of 250 men was completed we discovered that about 40 percent of the men were from New York and another 40 percent were from Texas. The other 20 percent of us from other states became non partisan but interested observers of the chemistry between the New York guys and the Texans. The fellows from New York were kind of cocky and quick tongued while those big guys from Texas were kind of slow but you could see their tempers slowly rising as the New Yorkers got through to them. In time we all became close knit and good friends. We were all pretty mature guys and about one third of the men were married. But I'm getting ahead of my story. Back to the beginning of our training. Much of our initial training consisted of class-work, learning basic radio theory and learning and practicing international code. We had to learn to take clear text which is what I'm writing here and also coded messages which consisted of five letter groups which looked like this \"ACPIW BGFET OZMZI YGHDF\". Each five letter group was considered a word. We started out slowly and printed the letters by hand. Ultimately we had to work up to over ten words a minute by hand and then graduated to a typewriter, which we called a mill, and went on up from there to 20 or 25 words per minute. Some operators could go much higher yet. It took hours of practice and more practice each day. Captain Scofield also saw that we retained our good physical condition with morning calisthenics and field exercises. One morning we were informed that we were to go on a field march with full infantry back pack and weapons and bivouac overnight. We gathered our gear, assembled into two columns and took off at a brisk pace behind Captain Schofield. I think we must have marched 15 or 20 miles. We were also on water discipline which meant we had one canteen of water which had to last throughout the day. When we arrived at our campsite we each paired off with the soldier next to us to pitch a two man tent. Each man carried a \"shelter half\" which was like half of a pup tent. It took two men to make a complete tent. After pitching our tent we were told to camouflage them to hide from aerial surveillance. That being done we were able to relax and partake of our evening field rations. The next morning Captain Scofield had the first sergeant roust us out, have breakfast and repack our gear. Then the march back to our base began. About a half mile from the barracks Captain Scofield, who was also carrying a full infantry pack, challenged all to a race back to the barracks. He announced that anyone who could beat him back would get a three day pass to town. Most of us were too tired to even try though a dozen or so did take up the challenge and two or three got their three day pass. I apparently was blessed with a good set of feet because I never did have any trouble foot-wise. Some guys were in misery and a few had to drop out of the march both outbound and inbound and be transported back to base in trucks. On the way back, however, my tent mate of the night before and I started to itch terribly and break out into a rash. What we had done was to camouflage our tent with poison ivy among other plant life. He and I ended up for the better part of a week in the Camp Crowder base hospital in the poison ivy ward. We were painted, almost head to toe, with pink calamine lotion. One black soldier was in our ward with the same problem and we nicknamed him \"Pinkey\". As we got a little better we had some pretty good card games including both bridge and poker. During our time in the hospital we missed a few sessions on the firing range using the old WWI Springfield and Enfield rifles. One day I spent so many makeup hours on the range that my right shoulder felt like it would become unhinged from the repeated recoil kick of the rifle butt. That also may have been the start of my later hearing losses. Each solder had two pairs of boots. We were encouraged to wear one pair one day and then switch to the other pair the next day to keep them aired out and to keep our feet in good condition. One day our first sergeant instructed us to straight lace one pair and cross lace the other. Then we were to wear the straight laced pair on the days he assigned and the cross laced pair on alternate days. We all rebelled at being treated like a bunch of little kids so we all straight laced our left boots and cross laced our right boots so each day we were wearing one of each. The sergeant kind of laughed and gave up. Our next door neighbor at Camp Crowder was a pigeon company. Those guys raised and trained carrier pigeons which were still used in World War II. Boy they sure were dedicated to those pigeons and were a total breed apart from the guys in our signal company. A few months after we arrived at Camp Crowder the Pigeon Company was given orders to ship out for overseas combat duty. Some of the men were washed out of the company and three or four were transferred to our company as cooks, of all things. Those new cooks didn't integrate into our company too well for several reasons. Foremost they weren't such hot cooks and we accused them of trying to feed us pigeon feed. Also they weren't the most intelligent guys in a company of mostly hand picked intelligent guys. They also had the habit of going around cooing like pigeons to annoy us, especially at night. Ultimately they were transferred out of our company to our great relief. (As a side note, I just read in the December 1995 issue of the Smithsonian that there were 17,000 homing pigeons at the end of WW II. \"These were offered free to anyone who would send a cage. The Army promised to hold any female pigeons through at least three nesting cycles - so they wouldn't return to the Army camp.\") One day I had just come in from some field training and was sweaty, dirty and somewhat unshaven when I was summoned to the company orderly room. When I arrived, there I was greeted by Lt. Kirk Bennett, all spit and polish in his officer's uniform. I felt like kicking him in the shins for suggesting that I first take basic training. Anyway he stopped by to say hello and find out how I was doing. My answer was \"Just take a look for yourself\" and 'How do I get out of here?\" I wrote a request to Captain Scofield for a transfer to a Port Marine Maintenance Company of which I had heard and might use my engineering training and where perhaps I could further my own engineering education with some practical experience. I said in my request that I had almost four years of aeronautical engineering education. Captain Scofield called me into his office and asked me one question \"What is Reynold's Number?\" I replied that the equation for Reynold's Number was \"RN equals Rho Vee Dee over Mu\" He then asked about its significance and I told him that one purpose was to determine whether air flow was in the laminar range or turbulent range. Having taken just enough aerodynamics at West Point to ask these questions he must have been impressed with my answers because he said that he would immediately approve my request for a transfer. Weeks went by without any word. When one day Captain Scofield called me into his office and regretfully told me that the transfer was denied. He said that it had been approved all the way up and back down the chain of command when some Major at the end of the list turned it down because it was against his policy to transfer personnel from a combat group company to a service company such as Port Marine Maintenance. At that Point I concluded that trying to get a transfer was an exercise in futility and that I might as well settle into the 60* Radio Signal Intelligence Company and make the best of the situation for the duration of the war. Camp Crowder had its own little newspaper in which articles were published of general interest and about companies and individuals on the base. I was asked to write a little column for the 60* Signal Radio Intelligence Company. One article I especially remember writing was about our mess hall, mess sergeant, cooks and guys working on KP. I made it especially complimentary to the mess sergeant and his men and to the quality of the food. I don't know whether the other men in the company bought my BS but the mess sergeant was sure pleased and I got some after hour's goodies from the mess hall in return. One day I spotted a note on the Camp Crowder PX bulletin board asking for any Phi Gamma Delta fraternity men to sign up for a pigless pig dinner. Pig dinners were and still are a Phi Gam tradition but there weren't the facilities to roast a pig on the base. Thirty Phi Gams and pledges did sign up and we all had a delightful dinner and fellowship at the Hotel Conner in Joplin, Missouri. The fraternity brothers ranged in rank from Captain to Buck Private but we were all of the same rank for that evening. Many weekends we'd get a weekend pass and occasionally a three day pass. During weekend passes some of us would head for Neosho, Joplin or even Nevada, Missouri where I remember was Coty College, a girls school. With longer passes I'd head alone for Kansas City by train. One place in Kansas City I enjoyed was the Meuhlbach Hotel where they had a geat dining room and live orchestra entertainment. I also stopped by the USO where I met a girl, who's name I can't remember. One evening she joined me for supper at the Meuhlbach. About dessert time the leader of the orchestra came over to our table and asked her to come up on the stage and sing. She gracefully declined so as not to interrupt our dinner. There was a dance floor also and later we danced a few numbers. A sailor at an adjoining table was sitting all alone when he ordered a cupcake with a candle on it. When it arrived he lit it and sang \"Happy Birthday to Me\". The next thing we knew was that he and my date and I were invited to be guests of a group of three couples at a ringside table. The host turned out to be the liquor wholesaler for the Muehlbach. After I returned to Camp Crowder I corresponded with my Meuhlbach date. She invited me for dinner with she and her parents the next time I could come to Kansas City. So a week or two later I got a three-day pass and caught the train for Kansas City. When I arrived at her address I found it in a super affluent neighborhood. She invited me in and introduced me to her parents. Her father in turn introduced me to their house guest who turned out to be a refugee German scientist and the man who designed the optical targeting systems for some of the large German battleships which were then prowling the Atlantic. I'm not sure what her father did but he appeared to be well up in some engineering or scientific activity and quite wealthy. They were wonderful down- to-earth people and we all sat there for several hours visiting about both technical and non technical subjects. Then we all went out for dinner. Fortunately my time at Camp Crowder was drawing to a close because otherwise things could have become uncomfortably serious there in Kansas City. To this day I can't remember her name which probably is just as well and maybe was a part of my defense mechanism. Next Stop to Fort Benning, Georgia Back at Camp Crowder we were informed that we would be attached to the Second Army and moved to Fort Benning, Georgia. Fort Benning was predominantly and infantry and paratrooper training facility. Rather than convoy our trucks and equipment to Fort Benning, Captain Scofield had somehow arranged for it to be loaded onto flatcars and for we soldiers to ride in sleeper Pullman cars and a dining car with porters, no less. Enroute we took turns drawing guard duty where one armed soldier rode in the cab of one of the trucks on each of the flatcars. Whenever the train stopped we had to dismount the truck and stand guard on the flatbed railroad car to keep curious civilians at their distance. We were loaded with live rounds of ammunition in case of trouble. There were several instances where one of the guards had to slip the amo cartridge into his carbine to ward off an intruder. In the meantime, those not on guard duty basked in the luxury of the Pullman cars. Poker games went on incessantly and the porters had trouble getting our berths ready when it came bedtime. Fort Benning was a huge post, in fact one of the largest in the US. I somehow remember that it was 500 square miles in area. As we drove our trucks across Fort Benning to our wooden, one story, barracks we passed beautiful two story brick barracks with lovely courtyards, a modern PX, brick movie theater and big houses for the officers; in fact all of the permanent structures and beautiful landscaping of an old permanent military post. We also passed rows of high jump towers used to train paratroopers and a modern military airport used for the same reason. It made us feel like we were now getting into the real serious business part of this war. Our training intensified at Fort Benning. Having become proficient in high speed international code we now began training to learn how to take German code. Since much of it was similar to international code we picked it up quickly. Some of our men were trained in cryptography, others in radio traffic analysis, while I was in a group specializing in radio direction finding. This was where two or more radio direction finders (RDFs) could take a bearing on an enemy radio transmitter, send these bearings to a plotting room where the cross bearings could be plotted and location of the transmitting station pinpointed. The key to all of this was that by knowing the location of the enemy radio transmitters, the organizational level such as corps, division or army net and breaking their codes our traffic analysis people could deduce their troop disposition and intentions. We also had our own internal communications nets within our company. It included radio, telephone and teletype. Rather than use our radios we often strung telephone lines and used telephone or teletype for security reasons. My six by six truck carried one of the Radio Direction Finder towers and receivers. We also pulled a generator behind the truck to generate power for our direction finder and other radio equipment. It was a pretty good size generator called a PE 95 and was driven by a willies Overland engine. The direction finder tower was kind of like the one I've drawn at the right below. We put it together, kind of like an erector set and then installed the RDF receiver. Then we rotated the entire tower by foot until the scope indicated that the two outside dipole antennas were both the same distance from the transmitting station, in other word at right angles to it. We had to erect the tower in an open field area to minimize interference from surrounding trees and structures. We also ran guy wires from the tower to stabilize it. Our training really intensified here both in intelligence training and field combat training. Since this was basically an infantry and paratroop training post we were put through much the same training on the ground as they were. One of our exercises was to go through an infiltration course at night. This exercise consisted of crawling on our bellies, through mud, under barbed wire with our rifle crooked in our arms. Land mines were set off around us while we were crawling through the course and live machine gun bullets and tracers were fired over us just three feet off the ground. Believe me, that discouraged anyone from standing up and running or even raising their butt up off the ground. I'd forgotten about a candy bar I had in my shirt pocket until afterward. Well it turned out to be a soggy mess all over my combat uniform. Another course was for house to house combat. They had created a village which we were expected to take on a house by house basis. We didn't use live ammunition but had to go through the motions and were evaluated accordingly. There were pitfalls, fake booby traps and enemy \"snipers\" that were encountered and many of us became fake fatalities. The men in our company were armed with carbines which took the place of pistols as side arms. Carbines were small, light weight rifles which uses ammunition clips and were designed for semi-automatic fire. They were easy to sling over the shoulder and could quickly be twirled into firing position. The exception were the truck drivers, which included me. We had a rack on our truck next to the driver's position to hold a 50 caliber Thompson submachine gun. The problem was that when we went on a hike we had to carry our weapons. The Carbines were easy to carry but the Thompsons were a bitch. Some guys even got tired and dragged them along the ground when they could get away with it. Later we were all given Carbines. At Fort Benning we not only had to qualify with the Carbine and Thompson but also the Bazooka anti-tank weapon and heavy barreled machine gun which sat on a tripod. I don't remember that we had to fire the M1, which was common during WW I. The firing range consisted of a row of positions where we would fire at fixed targets from the standing, kneeling and prone positions. The targets were raised and lowered from behind an earth berm some 50 or 100 yards away. We took turns on the firing line and behind the berm, raising and lowering the targets and recording the hole locations and scoring them. After a complete miss we raised a flag on a pole which we called Maggie's Drawers. One day we pulled down the target and discovered that a bullet had gone through the target the wrong way which meant that someone behind us had fired a round. Everything came to a screeching halt while an investigation was started on where the round came from. I don't think they ever did find out. For some reason our company was always picked to try out new innovations. Someone came up with the bright idea for converting the carbines to full automatic so they would continue to fire as long as the trigger was depressed. Well, the carbine is so short and light weight that if the first round went through the bull's eye the second round would be 10 feet above the target. The carbine was so light that the recoil of the first round would cause the barrel to rise. When in the semi-automatic mode the sights could be brought back down before the next round was fired. Some time later someone came up with the nutty idea of equipping the carbine with a bayonet stud and bayonet. During some field trials we broke a few carbines and proved that the carbines weren't long enough to reach the enemy soldier with a bayonet before he had already reached us with his. One day our company was assigned to go to the hand grenade training range. I was asked to take a weapons carrier and pick up a load of hand grenades for the exercise. The grenades had been carefully packed in wooden boxes which were neatly stacked in the bed of the weapons carrier and filled it completely. I drove the three or four miles to the training range more carefully than I've ever driven before or since. The training range consisted of a row of three sided booths or parapets which were enclosed by an eight foot sandbagged wall at the front and both sides and open at the rear. Two men were assigned to each booth. We were instructed to pull the pin on the grenade and then lob it like a shot-put over the parapet wall into the no-man's-land in front. A cook in the parapet next to ours bounced his live grenade off the top of his wall and it bounced over into our booth. My buddy and I got out of there real fast and ducked into the next door booth before the grenade went off. When we went back to our booth there was sand all over the place from the shrapnel piercing the sandbags. That really shook us up. I was sure glad when that exercise was over. At the end of the training exercise the rest of the company departed but another soldier and I were assigned to check the field in front of the parapets for unexploded grenades. When we found one, we'd lob a grenade to land near it and then hit the ground on our bellies so the upward trajectory of the shrapnel would miss us. We were trying to explode the dud grenade by what is called sympathetic detonation. Try as we might we couldn't get that dud to go off. So in frustration and without thinking I walked over, picked up the dud and carried it back to just outside one of the parapets. Then I laid a live grenade right next to it, released the lever and ducked inside the protective parapet. That time the dud did go off. But to this day I shudder when I think of how dumb I was to pick up the dud. Another time, we were on the Thompson sub machine gun range. The trick with the Tommy gun was to squeeze off very short bursts of fire to maintain some degree of accuracy. The targets were outlines of human figures. After we finished our exercise my buddy and I were left behind to clean up the area. He saw a crow perched on the lower limb of a tree. He raised his Thompson, aimed at the crow and emptied a full clip of bullets. When he was done the crow was still perched on the limb. He didn't even come close. Our radio intelligence training was also becoming intensified as we unpacked and set up our equipment and ran field exercises. Then we took it down and repacked and reloaded it onto our trucks. We had to do this efficiently and in a minimum of time. The lucky guys were the intercept operators who simply parked their truck and stepped into their radio shacks which were mounted on the bed of the trucks. For our internal communications security we had authentication tables which allowed us to challenge and verify each other's legitimacy before transmitting messages. One day we were instructed about what to do in case of imminent capture by the enemy. Since our authentication tables were on digestible paper we were instructed to wad them up and eat them. Then we were told to selectively knock off certain knobs and damage other key elements of our radio equipment. Then we were to dig a hole, put it in the hole and either douse it with fuel and set it afire or drop an explosive on it. Then we were to bury it. We asked if we could request the enemy to hold off capturing us while we did all those things. One guy said the first thing he'd do is to run like hell. We were getting so saturated with both field combat training and radio intelligence training that a couple of our men requested transfer to the paratroops. Now the paratroopers were the cockiest bunch of guys you'd ever want to meet. Everywhere they went was on the double. Physically and mentally they were trained to be, and think they were, the very best of the elite. In fact they said the Fort Benning hospital was half filled with paratroopers and the other half was filled with the Military Police (MPs) who tried to arrest them for tearing up the place when they were on liberty in town. The nearest town to Fort Benning was Columbus, Georgia. It was simply overrun with service men so Eddie and I tried to avoid it when we were able to leave the base. The other town was Phoenix City, Alabama which was right across the river from Columbus. Now Phoenix City had the reputation of being the naughtiest, baudiest, roughest town anywhere in the US. Every other place in town was a strip joint, bar or whorehouse. One day eight of us decided there'd be safety in our numbers so we'd go take a look at Phoenix City just to say we'd been there. Four of our guys were big Texans which also helped our feeling of security and protection. It was just as well because in one dive some guys tried to give us some trouble since we were jus sissy signal corps guys. Well, one of our big Texans, whose name was Bohannan, broke a bottle on the edge of a table, walked over to the doorway and announced that anyone giving us trouble wouldn't get through that doorway alive. That quieted things down long enough for the rest us to gracefully make our exit under Bohannan's outstretched arms. After the war was over I heard that the Alabama National Guard closed down Phoenix City's bad places. Eddie Danzinger and I always hitch hiked our way away from Columbus whenever we got a pass or leave from the post. Our favorite spot was the college town of Auburn, Alabama. When we had more time we'd head for Birmingham. We did get a pass during Thanksgiving while at Fort Benning so we headed for Auburn. It was far enough away that there weren't many soldiers in town so we were treated like guests. At the local servicemen's center we met a Professor and his wife who ended up inviting us to their house for Thanksgiving dinner. That was a real treat. Also we enjoyed meeting the local college girls for dancing, games, conversation and learning about the college. One time we heard that the Coca Cola Spotlight Band would be visiting Montgomery, Alabama. These were the big name big bands of the day. So Eddie and I got an extended pass and hitch hiked to Montgomery. When we got to the dance we discovered that there were about two girls for every man present. To give the gals a fighting chance they had a series of girl tag dances where the girls could cut in. One kept cutting in to dance with me so during intermission I invited her to have refreshments with Eddie and me. One day, back at Fort Benning, the announcement came that we'd be packing up and moving to Camp Chaffee, Arkansas for combat maneuvers. Off to Camp Chaffee, Arkansas for Maneuvers Instead of rail transportation we would convoy our trucks over the highway to Camp Chaffee which I remember was near Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The trip would take two or three days because of the two lane roads, many towns and the size of our convoy. Our trucks had been equipped with governors to limit their speed but we had removed or disabled ours so we would roll along at whatever speed was allowed. The convoy was led in a jeep by our commanding officer, Lt. Dick Stafford, who had replaced Captain Scofield who had been given an overseas assignment. Dick had been at lowa State University and a year behind me. His dad was a local banker in Ames. The tail end of the 66 truck convoy was brought up by the motor pool mechanics who could help anybody in trouble. Also, Dick sent out an advanced party in another Jeep, about a half day ahead of the convoy, to make overnight arrangements and also arrange for local entertainment. We barreled along at about sixty on the open highway with lots of space between trucks so we must have been spread out over a couple of miles. When we came to a town the vehicles started closing the gap between them and soldiers were stationed at the intersections to give us the right-of-way as we sailed through town. I think some of the local people were agape and aghast as we roared through their little burgs. In some town there were so many twists and turns that all we could do was to follow the vehicle ahead and hope he wasn't lost. Going through one city, a truck in the middle of the convoy started having engine trouble so pulled off into a Kroger store parking lot. Well, the rest of the convoy followed him into the parking lot until it was full and the rest lined up behind on the highway. It was a real mess and awhile before we could reassemble the convoy. The first evening we drove into an army post to spend the night. As we arrived we first pulled into the motor pool to gas and service our trucks which were then parked in rows on the drill field. When it was our turn, Eddie and I pulled our truck up to the gas pump. Before we could get out, three girl WACs were swarming over our truck pumping gas and popping the hood to check the oil, etc. Ed and I sat there wondering what to do since we had always serviced out truck ourselves. Besides we weren't sure whether or not to be chivalrous. Anyway we decided to sit there and enjoy the attention. Besides, those gals were businesslike and not prone to idle conversation. That evening we had supper in the post mess hall which was then cleared for an after dinner mixer and dance with the WACs. It was a great treat for both them and for us. I think the party broke up at about eleven o'clock when we all hit the sack in several of the post barracks. The next morning we learned that there had been a few cases of hanky panky between the gals and some of our men who shacked up in their radio shacks. However, there was no disciplinary action taken since we were too, busy by then, getting ready to hit the road for the next leg of our journey. When we arrived at Camp Chaffee our company was divided into three sections and each given its assignment. The maneuvers consisted of two armies pitted against each other in simulated battle. One was the Red Army and the other the Blue Army. The third small contingent was the White Force which consisted of the field judges and supporting staff who were the referees. My RDF unit was assigned to the White Force so we wore white arm bands. As I recall, the exercises lasted for about two weeks. My RDF crew were given a location to set up our direction finder tower in a field. Rather than a map we were given an aerial photograph with our location marked on it. The trick was to study the surrounding terrain and find that location on the ground which we did. Our little unit consisted of about eight men and we had my truck, a Jeep and a small weapons carrier. We were issued field rations and from that point were on our own except to report back to our headquarters by radio. Our mission was to monitor the radio communications and radio locations of both the Red and Blue Armies. We erected our tower in an open field away from a nearby forested area but pitched our tents and parked our vehicles under the cover of the trees. Then we rotated duty manning the Radio Direction Finder and other communications equipment. A couple of days into the exercise I had to make a run back to our White headquarters to exchange some batteries. I took the six by six truck and one other man with me on that run. Enroute we had to pass through the Blue Army lines. Along the way I came upon one of their roadblocks which was made up of heavy logs and could be closed very rapidly to block vehicles from passing through. It was designed to stop a tank. After checking to make sure I wasn't a spy, the officer in charge waved me on through the roadblock. It was quite narrow and as I drove the truck through it one corner of the truck caught on one of the heavy logs. This dislodged the log and as I drove on I looked in my rear view mirror and saw their roadblock. designed to stop a tank, collapsing into a heap of pick-up-sticks. We just gunned the truck and got out of there in a hurry. An anti-aircraft unit was bivouacked near our location. One day one of the officers came over to us to find out what we were doing with that tower. We told him that it was a new device that could locate his radio when it went on the air and could instantly bring in artillery fire onto his position unless his operator got on the air and then off without delay. Some of this was BS but we felt we were doing him a favor. That evening we snuck over to his encampment and heard him giving his men a lecture about the importance of radio security and procedures. That anti-aircraft unit had a full field kitchen with their own cooks. Later we showed some of their men our K-rations which they had never seen before. Then we trade some of our K-rations to them for some fresh fruits and vegetables from their field kitchen. During the exercises we also snuck into town with our Jeep and bought some groceries and cigarettes at the grocery store. It was really great being out there by ourselves with no one to tell us what we could or could not do except for our radio missions. We worked in shifts around the clock. At night our RDF tower was blacked out but we had a light inside to work by. I was on duty one night when I heard a bunch of army tanks headed across our field. If one of them hit the base of the tower or one of the guy wires the whole bit would come crashing down along with me. So I decided to unblack the blackout and opened the door to let out light and waved a flashlight. Apparently the tanks saw me because they veered of into a different direction. There was some pretty heavy equipment running around in our area after dark so it was a good thing that we had driven our trucks into the woods and pitched our tents between some good sturdy trees. One day I was told to set up a little mobile RDF set at the intersection of two airstrip runways. The little set could be carried by hand and was mounted on a tripod while I sat on a stool operating it. Why they put me there, I don't know. It was kind of scary with planes taking off and landing close by. We couldn't have any firearm or helmet with us while we operated any of the RDF equipment since the metal would create an error in the bearings we were taking. So we were really exposed in more ways than one. Some of our men, who were assigned to the Red or Blue forces, carried little suitcase Direction Finders. Their mission was to go in with the infantry to locate and capture or destroy enemy radio stations or transmitters. Of course those guys were prime targets for the enemy soldiers so it wasn't a welcomed assignment. The maneuvers were a success though I don't remember who won the battle. We did learn that our intelligence wasn't always accepted as being accurate or believable until it was too late. One of our Blue Army operators reported that he picked up the approach of an enemy force on his RDF. He was told that something must be wrong with his equipment since that couldn't be. He came back with word that it was true since he could now see them with his own eyes. Back to Fort Benning The trip back to Fort Benning was a reversal of the trip to Camp Chaffee along with the one-night stand en-route. After we got back to Benning we settled back into our old routine of a mixture of intelligence training with a few breaks into town between. I'd forgotten to mention earlier that this was the deep south and racial segregation was extremely strict and rigid. In fact there were completely separate busses from Fort Benning to town for the black (then referred to as colored) soldiers. On the post there were separate barracks, post exchanges and all other facilities. Somehow I picked up a case of athlete's foot, probably in the shower. It finally got bad enough that I went to our dispensary to get something to treat it with. Instead I was sent to a clinic clear across the base. There they made scapings and did all sorts of tests and gave me some ointment to apply with the instruction to return for more tests every three or four days. I discovered later that this was part of a research project to learn to understand and find a cure for athlete's foot. A military base the size of Fort Benning was apparently the perfect laboratory for this research. Whatever they did, it cured my athlete's foot and from then on I wore sandals into the shower. One day we were called into formation and told that we were to be transferred to a post called Vint Hill Farms near Warrenton, Virginia. We'd never heard of the place and wondered what anyplace with that kind of name would be like. We were informed that it was the number one signal intelligence post in the country with the highest level of security. In fact those of us in the 60*i Signal Radio Intelligence Company had by now been subjected to extreme investigation and scrutiny and had been given what was called \"cryptographick clearance\" \". I later learned that some people back in Iowa had been questioned regarding my background, activities and probably my character. Furlough and Home to Des Moines Before our transfer to Vint Hill Farms we were all givin a two week furlough. This was enough time to hitch-hike back to Iowa and visit home. That was quite a trip. During those days a soldier didn't have any trouble getting rides from truck drivers and civilians. I guess they thought it was a part of their contribution to the war effort. The first night out I caught a ride with a semi-trailer driver. I noticed that he was carrying a pretty heavy load which he confirmed was a full load of toilets, though he called them something more crude. The springs on the truck were practically ridding on the axels and we were headed into mountain driving at night. The driver said he was kind of tired and suggested that I take over the wheel for a spell. I politely declined and began looking for an excuse to terminate that ride. My chance came during a rest stop when I told him that I'd decided to spend the night there and go on the net morning. I did find a room for the remainder of the night. The next morning I started out again and was fortunate to pick up a couple of rides without any trouble. That afternoon a couple, about the age of my mother and dad, picked me up and after we had driven and visited for a while they invited me to their house for a shower, to rest up and for supper. After the welcomed shower I sacked in for about an hour and then got dressed for dinner. We had a nice visit and they told me about their son who was an airforce pilot flying the Burma run with the Flying Tigers. In the middle of our meal their doorbell rang. They answered it and after what seemed like an eternity they came back to the table and informed me that their son was missing in action. I tried to gracefully excuse myself and be on my way but they would have nothing of it. Perhaps my being there did give them something to hold on to. Anyway the rest of that evening was one I'll always remember about grace, caring and understanding. They insisted I spend the night which I did with the understanding that I would leave early next morning before breakfast and be on my way. I don't remember much about the next series of rides but when 1 got to Chicago I decided to catch a train the rest of the way to Des Moines. The train arrived after dark and there weren't a lot of people who got off there. When I did I was confronted by a woman WAC MP who demanded to see my papers. She was over six feet tall and built like a full back. I said, \"Yes Sir!!\" and dug out my furlough papers. Then I remembered that Des Moines was the national training headquarters and post at Fort Des Moines for the Women's Army Corps or WACs. I guess I hadn't done a good job of letting mother know when and how I would be coming home. Before I arrived she had gotten a call from the couple with whom I had spent the night telling her that I had been there and had left my dog tags hanging by the shower and that they would mail them to me. You see, at that time our dog tags included the name and address of our next of kin, which was mother. They don't include that information any more for security reasons. I spent the better part of a week visiting with Mother, Dad and Marcia, catching up on sleep and doing a little updating sightseeing in Des Moines. One evening, I borrowed Dad's car and drove downtown to explore the local USO or Canteen. When I walked in, there was big jar filled with corn kernels. I was asked to write down my guess as to how many kernels were in the jar to win some kind of a door prize. Then I realized that I was in the minority since most of the soldiers were WACs from Fort Des Moines. The activities were pretty tame being limited to table games, reading, refreshments and just visiting and conversations. As it turned out, I did win the door prize but to this day I don't remember what it was. When I was about to leave, four of the WACs asked me for a ride back to Fort Des Moines. Against my better judgement I said OK and then realized that one of them had been drinking pretty heavily but figured the others would take care of her. So we loaded into Dad's car and headed for the Fort. Partway there she got sick. After arriving at the Fort I drove to the infirmary to deliver the sick gal and then delivered the others to their barracks. No more USOing for me in Des Moines. When it came time to return to Fort Benning I didn't have the flexibility of time so returned by bus since I could depend on their schedules. Next stop, Vint Hill Farms We were real excited about our transfer to Vint Hill Farms which was near Warrenton, Virginia and just about a 1 ½ hour drive from Washington, D.C. So we loaded all our equipment and personal gear into our trucks over a period of several days and then departed Fort Benning in convoy. It was around 600 miles to Vint Hill so we did the trip in two days. As usual, our advanced party arranged for entertainment and a dance that first evening. A gal from North Carolina and I kind of hit it off and I continued to correspond with her for a while after reaching Vint Hill. In fact I accumulated a few pen pals during my travels and it seems that the civilian girls enjoyed getting correspondence as much as the men in the service. One of the girls on my list of correspondence was Ruth Wilson in Morgantown, West Virginia. We arrived at Vint Hill Farms, which was in the middle of Virginia farm country and a few miles off the beaten path of main highways. It was completely encircled with double high wire fencing with one main security gate and was guarded by a series of guard posts around the perimeter. We weren't allowed to have cameras so the remainder of this narrative is without photos. Although our company was kept in tact in one compound for barracks, meals, etc. our men were assigned during the day to different areas of the post depending on their specialty and assignments. Each area or groups of areas required its own identification badge and we were restricted to only those for which we were authorized. However, everyone had access to the barracks, mess hall, motor pool, PX and recreation facilities. About 40 percent of the post personnel were WACs whose duties included clerical, radio intercept, cryptography, radio traffic analysis, etc. During off hours we could socialize with the gals and some of the men paired off for the long term and some even ended up marrying their WAC friend. A few of the married men got romantically involved with a WAC which was kind of sad to see happen. Some of the married men brought their families to Warrenton where they could visit them during their free hours. I think a handful of married men were even allowed to live off post. Most of us enjoyed an eight hour day and were pretty much free for the rest of the time. Some did work other eight hour shifts but mainly to operate some of the equipment which had to be up and running 24 hours a day. The radio operators in our company, including me, were assigned to classes to learn Japanese code. This was on top of the international code and German code we had already become proficient at. I'm not sure I can say much about the Japanese code itself except that we spent about four hours a day practicing receiving it to build up our proficiency and speed. At the end of each session the paperwork we generated was taken, under guard, to an incinerator and burned. I got so I could listen to code coming through the earphones and bat it out on my mill while looking out the window and thinking about home or the next trip into Warrenton or Washington. We were also taught to read code from blinking lights and signal flags. Some traffic was recorded on magnetic tape and transcribed later rather than directly off the air. When it was urgent to take it directly off the air, sometimes three or four operators were taking the same message so that if one made an error it could be filtered out. For what we considered dessert, we were allowed to take clear text messages right off the airwaves Clear text is what I'm using here and was interesting since it was hot news right off the military and civilian wire services. In fact Vint Hill Farms was the focal point for all radio intelligence activities so we were often the first to know about breaking news like when a foreign dignitary was to visit Washington or significant battlefield developments. I may have mentioned earlier that we weren't allowed to talk about our work or equipment to anyone beyond those in our immediate section. What annoyed us most was the sometimes we would pick up a newspaper, magazine or technical journal and read about the very equipment we weren't allowed to discuss among ourselves. Some of our intelligence was transmitted to headquarters in Washington by wire, but much was driven to our mother post in Arlington, Virginia and the Pentagon by armed courier. In fact I made a few of the courier runs myself and learned to find my way around the Pentagon without getting lost. The nice thing was that when I had a run in the morning and had delivered my sealed packets, I could spend the rest of the day in Washington with my car since I didn't have to be back on the post until evening. Our company continued to be the guinea pig for testing innovations in radio equipment which continued to pour out of the research laboratories. That way we were always on the cutting edge of the technology and were continually re-equippng our trucks with the latest stuff. We did occasionally draw other duties such as guard duty or were assigned to make motor pool truck runs to pick up supplies for the post but these were few and far between because of the number of men available. I had a couple of memorable runs. One evening I was assigned to take our big bertha wrecker and a helper to bring back an army staff car which had slid off the icy road about fifty miles toward Washington. It was dusk when we arrived at the scene and there was the vehicle nose down in a ditch. Emblazoned on the trunk were the words \"You've Done a Good Job\". It turned out to be a vehicle used for recruiting men into the service and I guess complimenting those already in. Because we had to keep the wrecker on the road we had it blocked both ways for about a half hour as traffic backed up in both directions. I remember one guy who had hitch hiked with a driver who spun around two or three times while trying to stop for traffic. The hitch hiker got out, thanked the driver and boarded a Greyhound bus which was stopped about three car lengths behind. We finally got the staff car back on the road and ready to tow back to the post. It was now dark and we had just gotten under way when I spotted a car halfway on its side in the ditch with its headlights still on and the horn blowing. I told my buddy that we had to stop and help whoever was in that car. So we pulled off to the side of the road and I went over to check the car out. I pulled open the door on the driver's side. I reached in a got hold of a pair of shoulders and helped the lady inside to get out. She turned out to be a beautiful, blond WAVE Lieutenant. She was terrified and didn't know what to do next. So I told her we'd pull her car out of the ditch and back onto the road. We disconnected the staff car, backed the truck across the highway, hooked into her car and pulled it back onto the highway while another traffic backup occurred. She wanted to pay us but we declined. Later while we were reattaching the staff car a gentleman came over with fifty bucks and handed it to us saying that she insisted. By that time she was gone so we had no choice but to split it and be on our way. One time Eddie Danzinger and I had just returned from a three day pass in Washington, D.C. and had turned in for the night. About two o'clock in the morning we were awakened and called out to formation. We were informed about a forest fire about ten miles away which was threatening some homes. We were told to get shovels, brooms, rakes and axes and load them into trucks and we'd be taken to go fight the fire. Few of us knew how to fight a fire but were told we'd be given instructions on where to go and what to do when we got there. It was a bitterly cold night and we ended up in the woods beating the brush and passing water buckets from a water tanker. Fortunately, there was no wind so we somehow got the thing under control. When no one came for a long time to pick us up, some of the men fanned the embers to get a little heat for warmth. We arrived back at camp at dawn and were informed that we had all done a great job and were issued a three day pass. Eddie and I were almost too tired to accept ours but decided to get a few hours of sleep and again take off for Washington. It was reported that there were ten women for every man in Washington, which I don't think was much of an exaggeration. There were not only the civilian girls working for the government but the Navy Waves, Army WACs, Marine WRs (Women Reserves), Coast Guard Service Women, and foreign service women from such as the British Auxiliary Territorial Services (ATS), French equivalent of our Waves and who knows what else. In addition most were screened and selected for Washington service and were the cream of the crop. I don't think our Vint Hill Farms WACs were too thrilled to see Waves from Washington, D.C. transported by the busload to Vint Hill for some of the post dances and mixers. I learned that many of the States had State Societies in Washington. For example, there was an Iowa State Society made up of civilian citizens in Washington who came from Iowa. That meant mostly civilian girls and some men. I contact the Iowa Society to obtain a list of Iowans, hoping there might be someone I knew on the list. When I was told that there were about 2,000 lowans in Washington I decided to take my chances on meeting someone I knew. Eventually I did meet three or four that I knew back home. Many of the states periodically put on dances at one or another of the hotels, such as the Wardman Park. Eddie and I decided that when Iowa had a dance we'd be from lowa but when Pennsylvania held a dance we'd be become new Pennsylvanians and so forth. We were welcomed to them all since everyone welcomed a few more men and especially service men. The same situation was encountered at the USOs and other service centers which catered to service personnel. The girls just lined the walls hoping for an invitation to dance. During my stay at Vint Hill and excursions into Washington, I met and dated about five or six different civilian girls and one service woman. She was a sparkly little Irish girl who was also a Marine sergeant. Her name was Janet Patterson. Although Janet's home was in Washington, she and another woman marine shared an apartment off the Marine base so they didn't have any curfew to contend with. On time Janet invited me to go on an evening Potomac River dinner dance cruise of the Marine Corps. When I went aboard I discovered that I was the only army guy aboard. I stayed away from the railings since I didn't want to give some Marine the chance to shove me overboard and have to swim ashore. I must say the Marines were gracious hosts and I discovered that Janet was one of their favorite WRs. It turned out to be a delightful cruise. One time, while conversing with Janet, I used the term BAM in reference to women Marines. I'd heard some of the men Marines use it so thought it was OK. Janet got real upset and told me that it was a derogatory term and then explained to me that it meant \"Broad Assed Marine\" . I never used that term again. Janet's roommate was also dating a soldier who I never did meet. One day she told me that her roommate and that soldier had gotten married just before he shipped overseas for combat in Europe. Eventually her roommate received a letter from him stating that he had two small children by a previous marriage. That gal not only accepted that blockbuster but began saving her pay so that she could buy him a car when he returned to the U.S. Wow!! One evening Janet was seeing me off on a bus which would take me back to Vint Hill. There was quite a crowd waiting for various buses when Janet threw her raincoat over both of our heads and standing on her tip toes gave me a big hug and kiss. Many of the onlookers cheered and applauded and I guess I was a little embarrassed. As much as I liked and admired Janet I decided that it was time to cool that relationship. I think I had one date with her after that and then kind of faded away. Eddie and I did meet other girls after that but we double dated. for the most part. He and I also had fun just, the two of us, exploring the Washington restaurants. Our favorites were some of the Chinese restaurants. Around the perimeter of one restaurant were booths which were curtained. He and I had fun speculating what went on behind the curtains and who would emerge at the end of the meal. One time for dessert I ordered apple pie-a-la-mode. The Chinese waiter had memorized the menu but a-la-mode was not in his vocabulary. He did understand apple pie and the words ice cream. So I ordered both apple pie and ice cream separately. When they came I dumped the ice cream on the pie and pointing to it said \"apple pie a-la-mode\". Back at Vint Hill, when we were on base on Sunday, we generally attended Sunday services. Often both a Catholic Priest and a Protestant Minister would come from town to conduct the on-base services. The Jewish men often went to a Synagogue in Warrenton. One Sunday I was asked to drive into Washington to pick up a Priest and then return him to Washington after the service. When we got back to Washington the Priest invited me to have lunch with him. Before we ordered, he asked me if I'd like something to drink. Since he was Catholic I figured I'd better be safe and order a glass of wine, which I did. Then he placed his order for a scotch and soda which is what I rally wanted but then it was too late. I overheard a couple of priests at a nearby table order Irish coffee. I asked what kind of coffee that was and the priest laughed and told me that it was coffee laced with hard liquor. The taxicab system was kind of unique in Washington, D.C. Instead of using meters the cab drivers charged according to zones. The fare cost so much in one zone and then went up as the cab crossed over into other zones within the city. The more zones, the higher the fare. Sometimes the drivers would take circuitous routes from one point to another to increase the fare of the uninformed rider or maybe cut the corner of a zone to do the same. If the rider wanted to go to a foreign embassy, then the sky was the limit since the foreign embassies were considered to be on foreign land. Eddie and I always had a zone map with us whenever we took a cab so we could tell him exactly the route we wanted him to take. And talking about foreign embassies, I must tell you about one of my experiences. One of the men in our company, and a friend of mine, was Sergeant Adolphus Valenzuela, whose native country was Guatemala. One day Val asked me if I'd like to go into Washington with him and visit the Guatemalan embassy. I jumped at the chance. When the day arrived, Val and I hitchhiked out to the main highway where by prearrangement we were picked up by a limousine from the embassy and chauffeured to the embassy in Washington. Since we were in the U.S. most of the personnel spoke English as a second language. The first thing I encountered, as we walked in the front door, was a tray of cocktails. It seemed that every event in Washington involved conversation and a cocktail in one hand and sometimes hors d'oeuvres in the other. In fact, it was said at that time that Washington's per capita liquor consumption was three time the national average. The conversation got around to the recent but unsuccessful revolution in Guatemala. At the time of the attempted take over, Val happened to be visiting his home in Guatemala on a three week furlough when the fighting broke out. He got drawn into it on the government side and had to do some of the fighting. He said he saw more combat on furlough there than he did all during his active duty service in the U.S. army. When he got back to the U.S. they gave him another three weeks to recuperate and it was during that time that we visited the embassy. One of our favorite gathering places was the Service Men's Center which was located next to Lafayette Park and across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. The hostesses were civilian girls who were allowed to give us only their first names. There were tables and chairs throughout and around a good sized dance floor. There was also a big stage for bands and entertainers and soft drink and snack bars. I remember when one evening a hush came over the crowd and as we looked up to the stage, there stood Eleanor Roosevelt. She said that she was a neighbor of ours and just dropped by to say hello and wish us all well. One evening I met, danced and visited with a girl named Ann. Toward the end of the evening she said she would have to leave to catch a bus to her home in Baltimore. I asked her if I could meet her outside and walk her to the bus. She said she'd welcome the company. Once outside, the restrictions about first names only were off and she told me her name was Ann Fennesey. She also gave me her phone number and address and invited me to visit her in Baltimore when I could. A few weeks later I got a pass, so called Ann and told her I could come to Baltimore for a visit. She instructed me on what bus to take and where to tell the driver I wanted to get off, which was at a road intersection out in the middle of nowhere. When I arrived there, all I saw was a big chauffeured type limousine with one of the little small round windows at each side of the back. There sat Ann behind the wheel. When I walked up to her, she got out and said \"now you drive\". From there she directed me toward town and finally onto the campus of the University of Maryland where she was in her senior year. After taking me on a walking tour of the campus we headed back toward her home. It was a winding drive up into the hills outside Baltimore. As we approached our destination I saw a series of barns and a huge oval horse track. When I asked her about it she told me that it was where she schooled her horses and that it was part of her father's estate. Then we came to the mansion. By that time I wondered what I was getting into. We spent the rest of the afternoon while Ann introduced me to her mother and aunt and showed me some of the family photo albums. Some of the photos were of her father and various U.S. Presidents including President Hoover. That evening we attended a barbecue cookout and a sing-along with some of her friends and classmates. She told me that in the next few days she was entered in a steeplechase and that she was the only woman qualified in that event. After the barbecue we went out to the barns to check the horses. When she wanted one to get back in the barn she just gave him a good whack across the rear end and he obeyed. They sure knew who was boss around there. We started out early to go back to my bus stop in Baltimore so she directed me up to a beautiful overlook above town. After a while I told her I'd better head for the bus stop since I didn't want to be A WOL (away without leave) when I got back to Vint Hill. I had several more visits and correspondence with Ann but decided that the life style was too rich for my blood and concluded that she'd probably rule the roost whoever she married. Back at Vint Hill, we were called to formation one day and informed that we were to get our equipment in shape for overseas duty. Those of us with hard top trucks were told that part of the top would be cut out and a full track, heavy barreled machine gun would be mounted there. There were a lot of mixed emotions as some welcomed the chance for overseas duty and others hated to leave their families or the comforts of Vint Hill and Washington life. Then several days later we were told that the orders had been changed and we would stay at Vint Hill for the duration. In fact we were to be broken up as a company and integrated as part of the permanent post personnel and transferred to become attached to the Military District of Washington. This meant that we'd be working with, training, and servicing, all branches of the service including the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. We were becoming the hub of world wide US signal intelligence. We all became more relaxed, knowing where we'd be for the duration of the war. Eddie and I did a lot of double dating both in Washington and in nearby Warrenton. However we discovered about this time that we really didn't have to look out for each other when it came to dating. I discovered that Eddie was more the smooth, quick on his feet, 007 James Bond type when it came to the girls. He could simply love 'em, leave 'em and then go onto the next episode. I think that I, on the other hand, was more the opposite type with the girls. I didn't dare let myself get intimately involved knowing that if I did I would become one cooked goose and dead duck. I'm not sure whether it was my upbringing or my fear of falling into an emotional pit. Besides I enjoyed the company only of the girls I could respect and got turned off by those I couldn't. A little smooching was OK but nothing more as far as I was concerned. One evening Eddie and I rented a couple of canoes and took our dates canoeing on the Potomac River. Somehow we got separated so my date and I paddled along looking for Eddie and his date. Pretty soon we saw their canoe floating by itself out in the river. I figured that they had gone ashore and their canoe floated away so we started paddling over to it for a rescue. Part way there I noticed the canoe was rocking a bit so I turned away from it and told my date that they were still in it and dropped the subject there. Eddie and I did attend a lot of the State Society dances or just explored the countryside and places of historic interest. We also welcomed diversions such as motor pool truck runs as an escape from our radio duties. One cold evening we went to our Vint Hill supply depot on a grocery run. Four of us rode in the back of a semi trailer. One of the fellows had a bottle of Southern Comfort which is a sweet liquor. To ease the chill the four of us split the bottle. Between it and the bouncing and rolling truck, it wasn't long before I got real sick. For years afterward I simply couldn't even think about drinking anything sweet, especially Southern Comfort. During my correspondence with Ruth Wilson, I discovered that she had not been to Washington, D.C. even though it was just a few hours bus ride from Morgantown. So I suggested that she catch a bus to Washington and that I'd get a three day pass and show her around the city. We settled on a date and I made arrangements for a place for her to stay while I holed up in a nearby service men's center. We had a delightful two days of exploring the historic sites and restaurants of Washington. I told Ruth that I thought the war would be winding down in the near future. Somewhere along the line we got in a discussion about marriage but didn't make a commitment at that time. I did promise that when I got my discharge I'd stop by to see her on the way home to Des Moines and then we could pursue the subject in greater detail. About this time we learned of the death of President Franklin Roosevelt. Some few days or maybe a week later Eddie and I were in Washington at the Service Men's Center when it was announced that President Roosevelt's funeral procession would be passing by on Pennsylvania Avenue. We all rushed out to Lafayette Park, even with the girls, and witnessed that sad but historic moment. Back at Vint Hill Farms, we were informed that our old 60th group would go on a field exercise with our equipment. A few days later we loaded up and headed for the old Civil War Battlefield Park of Menassas where we'd set up our RDFs and other radio gear. By that time we no longer had our RDF towers but set up an antenna array on the ground. It consisted of five high antennas arranged in a pattern. The radio shack that we assembled sat on the ground and even had air-conditioning for the benefit of the sensitive radio equipment but we could enjoy it also. Besides we had 115 volt power from our generators so we could also keep the coffee pot brewing. My crew took turns at the RDF while those off duty went exploring the Civil War battleground. One of our men found an old musket buried in the river bed and other fellows found an assortment of shot. All of it was turned in to the park museum. About the second day into the exercise we were informed, on our radios, that victory in the Pacific had been declared, it was called VJ day and that the war was over. Talk about a bunch of happy soldiers, and to think that we were sitting on a Civil War battlefield when it happened. During the following several months we weren't very busy and kind of just passing time until we learned when we'd be going home. Some of us volunteered for other jobs. I got one as a dispatcher in the motor pool. It was kind of neat since when an interesting run came up for Washington I'd get someone to take my place as dispatcher an I'd take that run. Of course I would then have to do my sub a favor when the occasion arose. Whenever one of the mess sergeants needed a ride, even just across the post, I'd send out a car and driver for him. We got some great late evening steaks in return. One time, while in Washington, I paid a visit to Colonel Oliver Bennett, who was now stationed there in the Pentagon. I asked him about Kirk's whereabouts and plans. He said that Kirk was still overseas but would be heading back home and to Des Moines in the near future. Then he offered me an appointment to the War College in Washington where I could end up with a commission. The catch was that I'd have to sign up for three more years in the service after receiving my commission. I told Colonel Bennett that I was to be discharged in about two or three months and that I wanted to return to college and get my Aero Engineering degree. Back at Vint Hill we were told to load our radio gear and equipment in our trucks for transport to Camp Holabird, Maryland where we'd turn it in at the radio depot. When we arrived we pulled our trucks, one by one, into a huge warehouse. Soldiers with big forklift trucks unloaded the heavier stuff and we unloaded the lighter gear into piles. It broke our hearts to see the way they manhandled our equipment that we had been taught to treat with such tender loving care. Some of it was even dropped and smashed on the concrete floor. Some guys simply loaded some things, like smaller radio parts and test equipment back into the cab of their truck trucks while no one was looking. I think if anyone was looking they wouldn't have cared anyway. A lot of radio shops must have been set up after the war with this purloined equipment. I didn't want any part of this activity since I didn't want to jeopardize my chance for a clean discharge. We drove our trucks back to Vint Hill and turned them in to the motor pool there. The Commanding Officer at Vint Hill called most of the men into his office, one by one, and tried to talk them into staying in the service. Our skills and experience were such that there was no one to replace us in a peace time army. Many promises were made but it seemed that only the high ranking non- coms who were first sergeants or master sergeants were at all interested. One solder said \"Colonel, if you gave me those chickens on your shoulders I still wouldn't stay\". The day finally came for us to be bussed again to Camp Holabird for our physical exams and processing out of the service. They really gave us a thorough physical screening to make sure we were healthy before being sent home. Those that did have some sort of ailment or disability were held over for treatment so we were all real anxious to pass. Much of the time we were totally naked as we passed from one doctor to the next or were subjected to questioning. At one stop I looked at the officer sitting behind the table and recognized Carl Nordon who, back at Iowa State University was a Veterinary Medicine major and for a short time was my room mate. I said \"Hi Carl\" and when he recognized me we both broke out laughing at the ridiculous setting of our reunion. I passed the physical OK and then we turned in some of our extra personal gear but kept our uniforms and coats. We were also given a pin which indicated that we had served and were discharged from the service. We called the pin a ruptured duck because that's what it looked like. As I had promised Ruth Wilson, I hitch-hiked to Margantown and paid her a visit. I had got to thinking that here I am 26 years old and I need to get on with life, education and a career. We talked about the future at some length and then I up and proposed. Guess what - she accepted. Then I called mother Holt and told her of our plans. Since Ruth's mother was no longer living, mother suggested that she return to Des Moines with me and we'd have the wedding there. Ruth's brother, Caesar, said that he would come to Des Moines for the wedding and give Ruth away. The result of all this is that I would be discharged from the army, get married and return to college, all in one month. Whew, things were sure moving along fast. Trip to Des Moines and Iowa State University I had called Mother and Dad ahead to prepare them for the arrival of Ruth. Upon her introduction to them, and vice versa, mother took Ruth under her wing and did a wonderful job of doing all the things a bride's mother usually does, whatever that is. I was kind of on the motherly sidelines, but I had Dad and my old Ames roommate, Kirk Bennet, to turn to. About this time I began to have second thoughts about getting married. No reflection on Ruth but I wasn't sure that I was ready to take on the responsibility of marriage or that I had made the right decision about whom I should marry. Maybe I hadn't finished doing my premarital homework to determine such things as common interests and goals. Mother advised me that this was a decision for me to make and whichever way it went, now was the time to make it and she would support me in that decision. Since Mother wouldn't help me make up my mind I had to do it myself. After some soul searching I decided that going ahead with the wedding was the right thing to do for both Ruth and me. Having made that decision I never turned back or had second thoughts about it. So off to the races. One day, while Mother and Ruth were shopping and working on her wardrobe, I decided to drive to Ames for a visit with my Phi Gam friends and to have dinner at the house. I said something about my plans and that I was engaged and getting married in Des Moines before returning to school. Because school would begin right after our wedding and short honeymoon, Ruth and I later drove to Ames for me to get squared away on enrollment and to look for a place to live. Hundreds of married servicemen were starting their education so housing was at a premium and hard to come by. While having lunch at the restaurant in the Sheldon Munn Hotel, I mentioned to the waitress that we were in town to look for a place to live. She said that Mr. Hoover, who operated the elevator at the Sheldon Munn, had an upstairs apartment at his home near the lowa State campus west gate. We located him and after a few minutes of conversation he suggested that we go to their house and talk to Mrs. Hoover. We drove to the house and introduced ourselves. Apparently Mr. Hoover had called ahead and gave his blessing for renting the apartment to us. Mrs. Hoover took us upstairs via a private apartment stairway and showed us the apartment. It was more then we could have hoped for and at a very reasonable price, which I can't remember. It included a fully furnished nice front bedroom, kitchen, dining area, study area, bath and all the storage we could want or need. The location was one block west of the campus West Gate and next to a little flower shop on the corner. Since Ruth had been responsible for keeping the books for a Montgomery Ward store in Morgantown, West Virginia, we visited the Ames Montgomery Ward store where she applied for the bookkeeping job. They happened to be looking for a bookkeeper at that time so after an interview with the manager, Mr. Tate, she landed the job. Between her job and the support I would get under the GI bill we were now pretty well set to start school as far as living and finances were concerned. Talk about the luck of the Irish!! Talking about the GI Bill, I was entitled to a full four years of college under the bill. However, since I returned as a senior I'd be able to use only one year of it. On top of that I would have to start repaying a small student loan I'd taken out before I went into the service. The government would have forgiven the loan if I'd been drafted into the service. But because I had volunteered for service I had to repay it after I was to graduate the next year. Also while we were in Ames I started the process of re- enrolling in school and putting my schedule of classes together. Because most returning service people were starting in their freshman year, those classes were pretty well crowded. There were so few returning students in their senior year that out classes were to be extremely small. This was a blessing in that we would have lots of personal attention from our professors or instructors but in another way we had to have enough students to justify having the class in the first place. Now For The Wedding With our ;housing, college enrollment and Ruth's job taken care of we headed back to Des Moines to get ready for the wedding. While Mother and Ruth were doing their things, Kirk and I headed for the Younker's men's department so I could get out of my army uniform and into civilian clothes. Fortunately my size and weight hadn't changed during my years in the service so some of my old clothes, those which hadn't gone out of style, still fit. So we could do some mix and matching. However, much of my new wardrobe was from scratch. Caesar, Ruth's brother arrived the day before the wedding which was in March of 1946. I can't remember the exact date though I,m sure it is in the records someplace. It was in the small chapel of the Congregational Church on Ingersoll Avenuue with close friends of our family and some of my Ames fraternity brothers in attendance. There were perhaps 40 people there. Kirk was my best man and several of my fraternity brothers were ushers including my close friend Ted Paulson. After the wedding we had a reception and dinner across at a hotel on Grand Avenue. After dinner, the cake and toasting Ruth excused herself and changed into street clothes. We had arranged to use Mother's car on the honeymoon. Whoever was assigned to decorate it made the mistake of decorating Dad's car. So Mother and Dad drove home from the wedding with all kinds of honeymoon stuff written on his car and a tin can or two dragging behind. We then departed in Mother's car for a honeymoon at Clear Lake, Iowa. Dad had arranged ahead of time with his Clear Lake insurance agent, Carl Hass, to get us a motel on the lake. The next day, wouldn't you know, both Dad and Carl gave us a ring and invited us out to lunch. Later we were standing on one of the docks when I decided to take a picture of Dad and Carl with Ruth. I was standing at the end of the dock with camera in hand when they motioned me to back up for a better shot. Fortunately I looked back and realized I was about one step from the end of the dock. After a week of honeymooning we returned to Des Moines with mother's car and caught a bus for Ames and the continuation of my college days and the beginning of Ruth's. Getting Settled into the Apartment As I mentioned above, the apartment was fully furnished. The first day we were in the apartment one of the dining room chairs broke when I sat in it. I went down and told Mrs. Hoover and apologized for the damage. She said \"Don't worry about it\" That evening when we returned to the apartment we found that the old dining room set had been replaced with a brand new dining room set. Mrs. Hoover asked us if the lights were bright enough for my studying and both of us and said for us to get brighter light bulbs from her if they were too dim. We could hardly believe our good fortune to have a landlady like that. In the meantime Ruth was getting settled into her new job at Montgomery Ward. Her responsibility was to open the store in the morning for the other employees, get the cash registers up and operating, and then to do all of the bookkeeping and accounting for the store and finally to close out the registers in the evening. I think Mr. Tate was shoving some of his responsibilities onto Ruth. At the same time he didn't fully trust her to carry them out. Sometimes he would send someone to the store early to check on Ruth and to see that she was opening up on time. He didn't show up until later. I gave Mr. Tate the nickname of \"Irritate\" School Begins With class schedule in hand, my first job was to find the location of my classes and to visit the on campus bookstore and purchase the needed textbooks and supplies. The next day formal classes would begin. I was amazed by the hustle and bustle of literally thousands of freshman students, most just out of the service and some still in uniform. There was a lot of confusion as these new students were trying to find their way about. I helped many get headed in the right direction. Like everywhere else, the first day of school is one of meeting new classmates and instructors, getting class assignments and adjusting to a new environment. I was pleasantly surprised by the small size of my senior classes compared to the sometime overcrowded under classes. We had around ten or twelve students for each full professor. It was really a dream situation. The classes could be informal with plenty of interaction between the professor and students and classroom discussion among the students. Some of our courses were a repeat of those we took before the war. The reason was that during the three years of war the technology, especially Aeronautics, had changed so drastically that we had to update ourselves. At the beginning of the war airplanes were propeller driven and flew below the speed of sound. By the time we returned to school airplanes were becoming jet powered and had broken the sound barrier. So there were huge leaps in both engine technology and aerodynamics as well as aircraft structures. One of our courses was entitled \"Flight Testing'. That required us to instrument an airplane, test fly it and then analyzed the data and prepare a report. Most of my classmates already knew how to fly since they were in the air force as fighter or bomber pilots. Two of us had never flown before so he and I took flying lessons under the GI bill so we could do the necessary flight testing which was scheduled for the following quarter. Learning to Fly Since I was a senior Aeronautical Engineer my flight instructor didn't have to teach me the basics of how an airplane flew. So we started my ground school with the basics of flight rules and about the particular airplane we would fly. It was a tandem Aeronca. That is, there were two seats, one behind the other. It was what we now call a tail dragger in that it had a little swivel wheel under the tail as the third wheel. It was mainly constructed of wood and fabric. A joystick, rudder pedals and throttle controlled it. The joystick controlled the ailerons and elevators while the rudder pedals controlled the rudder. The instruments were minimal consisting of only an airspeed indicator, engine RPM, manifold pressure, altimeter and a compass. No radio or navigational instruments. Many years later I read in Chesley B. (Sully) Sullenberger's book that he had learned to fly in this same model Aeronca. He was the guy that landed the airliner in the Hudson River and saved all of his passengers. To start the engine of the Aeronca I had to take hold of the propeller in the horizontal position while the instructor sat in the plane and told me when to prop the plane by yelling \"contact\" '. I'd acknowledge his order and then gave a hard downward pull on the propeller as I stepped back away from it and to one side. Sometimes this had to be repeated several times before the engine took hold and started spinning the propeller. Then I'd climb into the front seat and we'd taxi out onto the runway. At first the instructor took the plane off the ground before handing the controls over to me. Then he had me do some gentle maneuvers to get the feel of the airplane. Later I was taught to do figure eights over a road and banks and turns and orient myself by direction and learn to judge wind speed and direction by observing the relative heading of the airplane and the course we were making over the ground. We were up one day, a few weeks later, when my instructor cut the throttle and told me to find a place to make a forced landing. I looked around for a grassy farm field, glided downwind and then turn to glide upwind onto the field. A couple of hundred feet before I was to touch down, the instructor advanced the throttle and we went back up while he critiqued my performance. I got so I looked for a haystack at the end of the field before selecting it for a forced landing. The runway at the Ames airport was grass and at one point had a slight dip. Sometimes we'd have the wheels on the ground, when coming in for a landing, and then the runway would drop out from under us momentarily and cause us to be airborne again until the plane settled back down. The trick was to come in and work the stick back to lower the tail and cause the plane to lose flying speed and settle down on to the runway. One day, while doing this, I looked back over my shoulder to see if anyone was coming in behind me. My instructor got real upset and told me that I could have ground looped the airplane doing that. Since the center of gravity is behind the main landing gear on a tail dragger a ground loop is caused by turning the plane and causing the tail to swing around until the plane is facing in the other direction. If we were going at a pretty good speed it could be devastating to the airplane and people in it. One morning we were practicing landings and takeoffs from the airport when my instructor opened the door, stepped out of the airplane and told me to take it up by myself, fly a pattern around the airport and bring it in for a landing. Normally we would use up much of the runway before becoming airborne. My instructor weighed about 200 pounds, so after he got out of the airplane I advance the throttle and was amazed to be airborne before I was halfway down the runway. Normally we flew beyond the end of the runway to 400 feet altitude before making a turn to the left. My problem was that I reached 400 feet before I got to the end of the runway. So I just leveled off until I felt it time to make my turn. Then I came around in a pattern downwind to turn and approach the runway facing upwind. I tried to land but came in way too high. The airplane wouldn't lose altitude fast enough because my instructor's weight was gone. On about the third try I did compensate and got the airplane on the ground. Now that I had become proficient at flying the Aeronca, my instructor told me that we would now go up and practice stalls and spins. That meant strapping on a seat pack parachute for in case we flew the wings of the plane. After we reached a sufficient altitude the instructor told me how to put the plane into a tailspin and then how to recover from it. He also told me to let the plane make two revolutions in the spin before taking it out of the spin and then know which direction I was flying after recovering from the spin. I found it awfully hard to count two revolutions when the ground was spinning around under me but I missed by only a half revolution and ended up heading in the opposite direction I thought I was heading. After a few more hours of instruction and solo flying, my instructor cleared me for a cross-country solo flight. I was to navigate by sight going west toward Boone, lowa and then turn south toward Des Moines before heading back to Ames. It was late in the season and as I approached Boone it started to snow. I was flying at about 4,000 feet and visibility rapidly became so bad I couldn't see the ground. At that point I decided to head straight back to Ames. After turning east I started dropping my altitude so I could see the ground and pick up landmarks to guide me home. At about 800 feet I began to come out of the snow flurries and visibility became clear and continued to clear more as I headed east using the farmer's fence lines and farm roads as a guide since the sections were oriented east-west and north-south. I didn't know exactly where I was. About the time I figured I should be back to Ames I sighted the end of the Ames airport runway directly ahead of me. What luck. Later that winter, after it snowed, they put skis on the plane instead of wheels. It was fun flying with skis but awfully hard to judge altitude by sight over snow. The first time I landed I thought I was 10 to 15 feet up when I heard and felt the skis sliding along the ground. The four Horsemen There were three other students in my senior Aero classes that had returned from the service and were also married. We became good friends and often got together in the evenings with our wives for two tables of bridge. These were Bob and Lois Lechtenberg, Jerry and Wilda Schryver, Whit and Evelyn McCormick, Ruth and I. One evening, during the bridge game, one of the guys brewed up some Irish coffee. They must have laced mine pretty heavily because later they told me that I'd made a grand slam. To this day I don't recall making any such grand slam. In fact I don't remember much about that whole evening. It was a good thing that we were within walking distance of each other. The school had acquired an Ercoupe airplane for our test flying. It had tricycle landing gear so we'd just fly it onto the runway to land it. We instrumented the plane with wires running to all of the control surfaces such as the ailerons, elevators and rudder. Each wire ended up at a dial indicator that showed the position of each control surface at any moment. These indicators were housed in a box that also contained a movie camera. Also in the box were duplications of all of the other instruments such as the air speed indicator, altimeter, engine RPM, etc. After a test flight we developed the film and analyzed the data from the flight. We most often did our testing in the morning during the winter months when the air was calm. Two of us would go up at a time. The first thing we did was to weigh the airplane after it was fueled and weighed ourselves. After the flight we again weighed in to determine the amount of fuel consumed during the flight. I was assigned to run tests at a density altitude of 4,000 feet. As we climbed, one of us would record air temperature and air pressure and calculate the density altitude which most often is different from the pressure altitude. The density altitude is calculated at standard conditions of pressure and temperature above sea level. Then I would put the airplane into all kinds of maneuvers to determine its stability in roll, pitch and yaw. This was done by putting the plane into a climb or turn and then releasing the controls so the plane was flying itself and trying to come back into a straight and level flight. For instance when put into a steep climb and releasing the controls the plane would go into a partial stall and then pitch its nose downward and pick up speed. As it increased speed the plane would level out by itself and again begin to climb until it again started to lose speed and stall. Each cycle became less pronounced until the airplane was flying straight and level all by itself. Back in the lab we'd plot these \"fugoids\" on a graph. Every two or three weeks we'd remove the engine from the airplane and run it on a test stand to measure its performance. One time, when the engine was remounted, a mistake was made in hooking up the fuel lines. Whit took off and in a few minutes ran out of gas to the engine even though he had two full wing tanks. Fortunately he was able to land in a farm field and stop just short of the farmer's fence. Our class project was to design an airplane from scratch. We decided on a four place canard design where the wing is at the rear of the airplane and a winglet is at the front, kind of like the Wright Brother's plane and the engine and propeller is at the rear. We had to design everything from the airplane itself, the controls, wiring and even the seats. We also built a model and tested it in our wind tunnel. Our only graduate instructor was T. (for Thornton) Wilson. He was working on his master's degree in Aeronautical Engineering. He would later become President and then CEO of Boeing Airplane Company. The Boeing 747 was developed during his reign. Just last year he endowed the Aeronautical Engineering department at Iowa State with one million dollars to train future educators in the field. I suppose Boeing will then try to hire some of them or their students. Smart move. Knights of St. Patrick Since I was the only returning member of the Knights of St. Patrick engineering honorary, one of the professors asked me if I would help him get the honorary up and going again in time for the Engineer's ball. Together we worked many evenings setting up the procedures for conferring the honor on qualified junior and senior engineers and then recognizing them on the stage during the Engineer's Ball. That year the number of engineers who were honored was six or seven but we figured they could form the nucleus to carry on the tradition during the following years. Ready for Graduation One day my faculty advisor called me in and asked me if I would be interested in graduating at the end of the quarter. That caught me totally by surprise since I thought I had at least another quarter to go. It seems that over the years I'd taken enough elective courses that would count to qualify me for graduation. After a moment of careful thought I blurted out that I sure would. My other three classmates were also eligible for graduation that quarter. I don't remember that we really had a formal graduating ceremony with caps and gowns and all, just got handed our diplomas, which was all right with us. That night we went out on the town with our wives. Had fun - nuff said. The four of us had had some pretty serious discussions about what we'd like to do after graduation. The aircraft industry was retracting from the war year's heyday of production and some engineers were getting laid off. Whit McCormack and Bob Lechtenberg said they were still going into the field of aeronautics. Jerry Schryver and I said we weren't interested in the uncertainties of the industry at that time, especially since we were planning to raise families. We kidded the other guys that we would invite them to our summer homes on the seashore when we made our mark in industry and they needed friends like us to turn to. Bob ended up as a high-ranking officer in charge of testing at the White Sands proving grounds in New Mexico. Whit became a successful executive with one of the aircraft companies. Jerry went to work at Green Feeds in Conrad, Iowa and has since bought the company and has a fleet of semi's which collect corn cobs for processing into abrasives. As for me - read on. Job in Chicago Since the aircraft industry was cutting back, I decided to look into other engineering fields. Besides, Ruth had become pregnant and since I had a family coming along I wanted something that would provide us with a little more security than the aircraft industry could provide at that time. But what to do? Dad suggested that while I was trying to get my bearings I might consider going to work for one of his Aetna Insurance groups, The Century Indemnity Company, headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. I was told that a Bob Johannsen who was the supervising safety engineer for Century would interview me. A few days later I caught a bus to Chicago and the next morning went to the Wrigley Building, on Michigan Avenue, where the Century Indemnity Company was located on one of the upper floors. They occupied about half of that floor. The receptionist called Bob Johannsen who came out and introduced himself. Bob and I immediately hit it off. He described the duties of a safety engineer as the eyes and ears of the insurance underwriting department. It would involve traveling in the area of Chicago and making inspections for public liability, workman's compensation, open stock burglary, plate glass, elevator and other types of insurance risks and writing reports for the underwriting department. It also involved making inspections after an insurance loss to determine the cause of the loss and to recommend ways to prevent such a loss in the future. One aspect of the workman's compensation inspections was to determine the type of work or operation of a company, to inspect the operation and to determine the various payroll classifications and salary rates. It occurred to me that this would be a great opportunity to learn of the various industries and how much they paid their workers, engineers and administrators. Bob told me that the job paid $210 per month. I had a number of questions about living expenses and transportation. Bob said that I would be furnished a company car and that I could use it for personal travel when not on company business. Under the circumstances I decided we could live on that salary so I accepted the job offer. Apartment Hunting While still in Chicago I went apartment hunting with Bob's help. At that time apartments were very scarce. In fact some people read the obituary column in the newspaper to try to rent an apartment vacated by someone who had died. Finally we heard of an apartment available on West Sheridan road just off of Outer Drive. Sheridan road runs north and south parallel to outer drive but jogs east and west for about four blocks just south of Irving Park Road. This was on the north side of Chicago. The apartment was one of two apartments on the second and third floors of an old, narrow antique residence house tucked in between two apartment buildings. It was the third floor apartment. The landlady, Georgia, lived on the first floor while the two upper floors were made into apartments for rent. Bob drove me out to the apartment. Georgia took us up to the third floor to check out the apartment. It consisted of one bedroom, a combination living-dining room, kitchen, bathroom and large enclosed back porch. It was also furnished. I forget the rental price but it was within our means so I rented it. Bob then arranged for me to borrow a company car to go back to Ames, get Ruth and our belongings and return to Chicago. A week later we moved into the apartment. Soon we met and became friends with Bill and Marian Fox, who lived in the second floor apartment below us. Marian was also pregnant with her first and expected to deliver that fall about the same time as Ruth so they had lots to talk about. After we arrived, I had to return the borrowed car, which was assigned to one of the other engineers who happened to be gone on an out-of-town trip during that time. For a period of time following WWII new cars were awfully hard to come by. For the first several months on the job I would have to use public transportation to get around until Century could find one for me. In fact the company said that if I could find a car, they would issue a check for me to purchase it for the company and then they would assign it for me. Job Indoctrination The first day on the job consisted of meeting other people at Century and learning about the job from Bob. As he took me around to introduce me to others he introduced me as Don Peoples. I couldn't correct him during the introductions so from then on Bob and all others called me Don at Century. By the time Bob realized that he'd made the goof it was too late. So Don I became from then on at the office. While on the job we were required to be dressed in a business suit, summer or winter. During the cooler weather we also wore a hat. We also carried slipover coveralls for some of the inspections, which involved construction sites, boiler rooms and the like. At other times we'd be in upscale offices or businesses. So we had to be dressed for the occasion of the inspection. During the first week or two I accompanied Bob on inspections while learning the ropes first hand. This involved not only the procedures for making the inspections but also how to diplomatically deal with the insurance applicants who sometimes became upset with our probing into their property and affairs. Most, however, were cooperative once thy understood the purpose of our visit. The procedures for making an inspection depended on the type of insurance coverage the applicant had requested. In the case of public liability coverage of a public building, we had to determine the type of business and occupancy of the building and measure the square footage of the building for each type of occupancy. For example there may be stores on the street level, offices and businesses on the second floor and apartments on all floors from the third on up. Each carried a different classification for insurance purposes. We also had to verify the occupancy to make sure there were no hazardous materials or activities associated with any of them. Then we had to identify any hazards such as broken stair treads, cracked materials, lack of proper fire escapes, worn stair carpets or other tripping or cutting hazards and the like. We included these in our report as recommendations for corrective action to the underwriters. They, in turn, required the building owner to correct these deficiencies as a condition for insuring the property. Later we were to follow up to verify that these deficiencies had been taken care of. One day Bob and I checked out the occupancy of a building which had stores on the first floor and offices on the second floor and those above. One door, on the second floor, had a sign that said \"Remodeling\". We assumed that it was an architect's or contractor's office. Bob opened the door and started in with me directly behind him. Suddenly he stopped and backed out as I ran into the back of him. I peeked over his shoulders to see some woman in a slip putting on a dress. We discovered that this was a dress remodeling business. We both broke up laughing as I discovered one of the hazards of being a safety engineer. Bob took me along on the full range of inspections including workmen's compensation, elevator (36 of them in the Chicago Board of Trade building), plate glass coverage and public liability. The businesses ranged from mom and pop stores to commercial buildings to apartment buildings to manufacturing plants and even a military school. Now on my own on the job Each weekday morning I'd catch a bus from the apartment to the Century offices in the Wrigley building located on Michigan Avenue. The location was just north of the Lift Bridge, which spanned the canal, and across the street from the Chicago Tribune Building. It was right in the heart of the business part of Chicago. The Wrigley building is a beautiful landmark in Chicago. It has a bank and shops on the first several floors and offices above that. The Walter J. Thompson advertising agency occupied the floor above us. There were also Doctor's and Dentists offices in the building. Each morning, on arrival at the office, I'd be given inspection cards, each of which listed the location and description of a place to be visited and inspected for the underwriters. The number of inspections depended on the type and complexity of each. Some days I could make four or five inspections and at other times I might spend days on just one. After each inspection I was to write up a detailed report of my findings including recommendations for correcting any deficiencies at that location. Many inspections required the measurement of the building to determine the square footage for each type of occupancy and the street frontage of the building. This sometimes got pretty complicated when the buildings were not rectangular and had inner courtyards. To take measurements I had a 100-foot tape measure. In my business suit I'd be out on the sidewalk measuring a building as people walked by and wondered what I was up to. Many stopped by for a visit. One day a big black guy walked up to me asked me if I was with the Kemper Insurance Company. I told him no, that I was with the Century Indemnity Company. He then said, \"It's a damn good thing\" and walked away. Sometime during my second week on the job I was riding a streetcar when a sharp stabbing pain went through one of my teeth. I practically hit the ceiling. About 15 minutes later it happened again. I took the next bus back to the Wrigley building and took the elevator to the dentist's floor. When he realized what was happening to me he got me right in for an examination. It seems that one of my metal fillings was making contact with the nerve in my tooth. The acid in my mouth made it act like a battery that built an electrical charge. When the charge became sufficient, it discharged right through the nerve in my tooth which gave me an excruciating jolt and pain. He recommended that I should have the tooth extracted and I couldn't have agreed with him more So extracted it was. The funny thing was that his chair was faced so his back was to a tenth story window. I warned him about the danger of this, being a safety engineer. Some of my Interesting Inspections One day I was given an inspection card for the Svithoid Singing Club. It was to include public liability, open stock burglary and workman's compensation. The location was on the near north side of Chicago. When I arrived at the address I found that it was a three-story brownstone building that appeared to have been a luxury private residence at the turn of the century. I walked up to the front door and rang the bell. A little window in the door opened and someone inside asked me my business. When I told him that I was there from his insurance company to make an inspection he opened the door. I showed him my credentials and he invited me in and asked me where I would like to begin. Since the place had a basement I said that I'd like to start there and work my way up to the top floor. So we went down a fancy stairway into the basement. The first thing I saw was a beautiful mirrored long polished bar with stools and tables and chairs nearby and stocked with a fabulous array of glasses, liquor bottles, etc. I asked if this was the total of the liquors since we were insuring for open stock burglary. He said that they had two bank-like vaults there in the basement and another bar upstairs near the dining area. So I got an inventory of the row upon row of wines and liquors in the two vaults and at the upstairs bar. Then we went up to the first floor where there were lounges, reading rooms, library, etc. On the second floor were gaming rooms with poker tables, blackjack tables and a roulette wheel or two but no slot machines. Then we went back down to the first floor and he walked us to the back of the building into a huge auditorium where little kids were taking dancing lessons. From there he showed me their dinning room which alerted me to the fact that they had a kitchen and food stocks. I asked where they kept the food stock and he said in two nearby warehouses. Holy smoke, what an operation. Before we were done I asked him what it took to become a member. He informed me that it began as a Scandinavian singing club many years before and kind of grew from there. I found just one major deficiency. The auditorium and dining areas didn't have sufficient exits or fire escapes. I pointed this out and he said that he agreed and it would be taken care of expeditiously. I went home that evening and after dinner spent the night until about two in the morning writing up my report. I was to learn that it was normal to make inspections during the day and then spend the evening writing up the reports. Many of the inspections were for public liability for apartment buildings. One day I got an inspection request for a group of three small apartment buildings which were grouped together on the near north side. The first thing I usually did was to find the apartment manager or caretaker to let him know why I was there and to get information on the number and type of apartment units, maintenance and other relate information. After providing the information, this manager asked me if I was married. When I told him I was he said \"That's a shame because the gal that inherited these apartments is single and I think she's looking Around for a husband\". It sure would have been interesting to know what she looked like. Anyway I spent the rest of the day measuring up the apartments, diagramming them and inspecting them for liability hazards. The only one I found was around a grass area between the sidewalk and street where they had put in stakes and run wires to prevent people from walking on the grass. This presented a tripping hazard if someone didn't see the wire. Also there were people who faked falls to collect insurance. So I wrote a recommendation that these wires and stakes be removed which they later were. On another occasion I had a request to inspect an apartment building on the south side in a poverty area inhabited mostly by black people. While making my inspection I knocked on one apartment door at random to talk to the tenants. Often I'd receive complaints from them calling attention to some hazardous condition. In this case the black lady invited me into her apartment to show me some problems and tell me about them. Her apartment was immaculate but there were some broken spots in the floor, frayed electrical wiring and the back fire escape rails were broken and the area under the fire escape was strewn with trash and garbage presenting a fire hazard. Boy did she ever give me an earful about the building owner. While I was in the apartment her two little children sat cringing in a corner until she told them that I was there to help them. Apparently they had associated me, because of my business suit, with the owner or other person in authority and were frightened. I was touched by their situation and made an extremely thorough inspection of the premises and wrote up twenty or thirty conditions which needed correcting, including torn stair carpeting, broken plaster and the like. I don't remember how this one turned out but hoped that my inspection may have helped that family. One of the more scary inspections was in the Chinatown area of Chicago. One building had Chinese owned shops on the first floor and apartments on the upper floor. After checking out the shops, which seemed okay, I went upstairs to check out the apartment occupancies. As I walked down one of the dark hallways I remembered the story about one of the other safety engineers who had gotten mugged in this same kind of a situation. As I walked down that hallway I could smell something that smelled like opium. When I knocked on one door a little window opened and a pair of eyes peered out at me. When I asked about the apartment occupancy all I got was Chinese gibberish and then the little door slammed shut. Bob had told me to just back away if a situation looked bad, which I did in this case and explained it in my report. One day I was checking out a workman's compensation claim involving a receptionist who got her wrist broken. Since that is not an occupations where one can easily get a broken wrist, the underwriters wanted some more detailed information on the accident. When I visited the office and talked to the receptionist, she explained that a big burly salesman, calling on their business, had introduced himself by shaking her delicate little hand and had fractured her wrist. In fact it seemed that the office environment was an especially hazardous one judging by some of the accidents that took place there. These included people standing up from under open file cabinet drawers, cabinets falling over, getting stuck with pencils, leaning back in chairs, you name it. One time I received a request to check out an accident in a metal working shop. Most punch presses are protected by guards, which prevent the operator from getting his hands in the press when he depresses the foot treadle to actuate the press. Some are gate guards which come down before the press can be actuated and others have sweep guards which are designed to swing in front of the smaller presses to knock the hand out of the way. In this case the sweep guard broke and the operator got his hand in the press and punched a hole through his hand. When I contacted his foreman to explain how the accident happened the foreman took me over to the press and while explaining and demonstrating the sequence of events punched a hole in his hand. So now we had two accident claims. Some Inspections were Humorous Once I was given a card for a public liability inspection of a business that had some kind of a funny name. There was no hint of the type of business. When I arrived there I found it was another of those big old places which were once fancy residences. When I walked in I was greeted by a receptionist and stated the purpose of my visit. When I asked her what type of business was conducted there she kind of smiled and told me that it was a place where girls entertained men, in other words a house of prostitution. I wasn't quite mentally prepared for how to inspect a house of prostitution and perhaps was a little embarrassed to boot. She called the woman in charge of the operation who escorted me through the building. It was immaculate and I could find no obvious liability hazards. Later, before writing up my report, I asked Bob how I should write up a house of prostitution. I think the other engineers had fun steering this inspection my way. One of the types of insurance the company wrote was for plate glass. For the most part, this included store windows, large mirrors such as behind bars and glass counter tops for businesses. Once we had a loss that occurred on the same storefront window twice in about a week's time. The window simply shattered of its own accord. During an interview with the storeowner he mentioned that he had painted a large target on the window to draw attention during a promotion. We finally realized that the afternoon sun fell on the large black bull's eye of the target causing the glass to heat up there more than the surrounding white area which reflected the sun. The heated part expanded creating excessive stress in the glass causing it to shatter, so no more targets on plate glass windows. A Car At Last After a month or so of trying to find a car, I mentioned my problem to Dad. He said he might be able to get me a new Chevrolet through a dealer in Des Moines who was a friend of his and from whom he had purchased a few cars for Aetna. Later he called me and said that he had a new Chevy lined up for me and gave me the price. Century made out a check to the dealer for the car and paid my expenses to Des Moines to pick it up. In the meantime Ruth had landed a temporary job so she had to work and stayed back in Chicago. Incidentally, when she applied for the job she told them that she was pregnant. They asked her what made her think so. She told them she knew so since she was three or four months along (I forgot which). Anyway, I had a good visit with Mother and Dad while the dealer was getting the car ready for me. As I mentioned earlier I would be able to use the car for personal use when not on company business. In addition I was allowed so much per mile when driving the car on company business. If I could drive it for less than the allowance I could use the extra- accumulated mileage for personal use without any cost to me. I did accumulate enough over the next year to cover our personal driving and for a vacation. Other Inspections I remember Sometimes we had to make check inspections to make sure that there had been compliance with recommendations for corrective measures called for in the original inspection. Once in a while we'd make a check inspection as a follow up to the original inspection made by one of the other engineers. One day I was asked to make a follow up check inspection of the Miss Muffet Nursery School. This was after a burglary of some typewriters where improved door locks were previously recommended. When I walked into the nursery school office, without thinking, I asked to speak to Miss Muffet. I thought the secretary would fall out of her chair laughing. I guess I turned a little red and then started laughing too. Another time I was to make an inspection of a home decorating business run by two young ladies. As soon as I introduced myself and stated my business one of the charming young ladies told me that the tie I was wearing was horrible and clashed with my shirt and suit coat. I forget what my response was but it sure threw me off balance and I had a hard time getting back on track with my inspection for public liability coverage. Areas of the near south side of Chicago were noted for break-ins and burglaries. One cold winter day I had an inspection there involving an auto parts business which had applied for both open stock burglary insurance and public liability insurance. On my arrival I walked in the front door but found no one in the office. Then I noticed activity clear at the back end of the warehouse area of the shop. So I started back through the shop. I was part way back when I saw something coming at me from above and stepped away from it. It was a huge black Doberman Pincher dog that was leaping off one of the parts crates. Just as he reached my overcoat sleeve he also reached the end of his chain. He shredded my sleeve but didn't get any of me. When I found the owner at the rear of the shop I showed him my coat sleeve and told him about his dog. Then I told him why I was there and that he sure had good burglary protection. Then he told me about how his business had been broken into through the rear loading door and how he had replaced it with a metal door and wired it to a high voltage transformer so whoever touched it would land on their butt. I agreed that he had good protection for burglary but that he could electrocute someone who happened to be passing by in the alley and touching the door so he was a poor public liability risk. I told him the Doberman was good enough in addition to the bars on his windows and door and his alarm system. He did disconnect the electricity to the door and the company later insured him. It was amazing to me how a business name can be misleading. One day I was given an inspection card with the name of a hardware company on it. I assumed that it would be either a hardware store or a hardware supply company. When I arrived I found it to be an entire complex of buildings and that it had evolved into a company that build exhaust systems for General Motors diesel locomotives. Instead of a one-hour inspection it took a whole day and required a whole evening to transcribe my written notes to my typewriter. Boy could I have used a good tape recorder and computer, which weren't available yet. Lumber companies and woodworking shops seemed to me to be the most dangerous types of businesses. One day I was making an inspection of a toy making business which had several spray paint booths equipped with exhaust fans because of the fire and explosion hazard. As I was approaching one of the spray booths I overheard one of the workmen telling another that an inspector was around and for him to douse his cigarette. I sure brought this to the attention of the foreman and wrote it up in my report to the insurance underwriters. In another case I walked into a woodworking shop just as a board, which was being ripped, on a large table saw jammed the blade and was catapulted through the wooden side of the building. No non-kickback guard was used on the saw, which could have prevented the kickback. Fortunately no one was hurt but could have been killed if impaled by that board. The scariest of all were the big lumber mills, which were equipped with huge band-saws two stories in height. If one of those huge blades had broken it could take out the whole side of the building. Another scary type was a flour processing mill. Airborne flour dust can become explosive if ignited and more than one mill has blown up and burnt down. The problem here is that a small primary explosion can kick up enough dust to create a huge and devastating secondary explosion. On one occasion I was inspecting an empty five-story office building which was being remodeled. On one of the upper floors I was walking from room to room while taking notes on my clipboard when I started to walk into another room. Before entering it I paused to look up from my clipboard and discovered that rather than a door to another room it was an open door to an elevator shaft. There was no barrier to prevent someone from walking into that shaft. After I recovered from my fright and regained my composure I became extremely angry to say the least. I located the building office and I'm afraid I read the owner out with a little profanity thrown in, in spite of the fact that he was the insurance company customer. I also reported what I had done to my supervisor, Bob Johannson, and he agreed with me 100 percent. The Wrigley Building The Wrigley Building was a beautiful landmark on Chicago Boulevard. It was right next to the canal leading from Lake Michigan and spanned by a two level roadway drawbridge. Whenever a ship had to come up the canal the drawbridge was raised blocking traffic on one of the busiest Chicago streets. One day the bridge had been raised and got stuck in the up position blocking traffic in both directions on both levels. Unfortunately it was rush hour so there was a real traffic mess. I did our banking at the Boulevard National Bank, which was located on the main floor of the Wrigley Building. I also had a safe deposit box there. I learned that some people in the building would brown bag their lunch but didn't want their associates to know it. So they deposited their lunch in their safe deposit box when they arrived in the morning. Then at noon they'd go to their box, take it to one of the enclosed rooms and eat their lunch. Who would know except maybe the bank clerk who admitted them to their box. That's how I found out. Air Force Reserves at Douglas Field As I may have mentioned earlier, I had signed over into the Air Force enlisted reserves when I got my discharge from the Signal Corps. This was to make sure that if I was to be recalled into the service it would be into the Air Force rather than the Signal Corps. While in Chicago I was assigned to the Air Force's Douglas Field, which later became changed to a commercial airport named O'Hare Field. It was really out in the boondocks at that time so was quite a drive for me, once each month to report for training and seminars. I wasn't a pilot but things were really slow since even the pilots assigned there had a hard time getting in their required flight hours because of gasoline restrictions and I guess postwar budget restrictions. Since I now had my aeronautical engineering degree I decided to apply for a commission in the Air Force Reserves. I was told that I had all of the necessary qualifications for a direct commission except that I was three months too old. Later I was to realize that this was the best thing that could have happened to me. The Arrival of Sara Ruth and I were often invited to Bob and Charlotte Johannson's home, sometimes for dinner. The Johannson's had a teen daughter and son who were excited about the pending new arrival in our family. In preparation for the coming event we went shopping for a Bassinette, crib and baby carriage with our neighbors Bill and Marian Fox, who I had earlier mentioned, were also to become parents at about the same time. Unfortunately we couldn't work out any quantity discounts but had lots of fun together. One evening in September, about the 16*h, ', Ruth started to have occasional contractions. I called Bob and told him about this development and he ordered me to stick around home with Ruth and forget the work for the next few days. We paid a visit to the doctor that day and he told us that the baby might come in the next day or in a few day but to be prepared to go to Pasavent Hospital if the contractions became persistent. On the next day they became persistent so that afternoon we headed for the hospital. It was a long evening and night but sometime in the early morning of September 18, 1947 Ruth delivered a cute little girl who we named Sara Ellen. The Sara was after her grandmother, Sara Holt, and the Ellen was the middle name of my sister, and her aunt, Marcia Ellen Holt. Passavant Hospital was real strict about visitors on the maternity floor. Only two visitors at any one time and I think two visits per day. Of course we had to work Bob and Charlotte in on a visit or two to meet Sara. The day to bring Sara home finally arrived. By then we had all the baby raising instructions we could absorb and hoped Sara could survive them. I think we even sterilized our hands and fingers before handling her. During our first visit to the doctor I asked, with some concern, whether Sara was getting enough exercise. She was kind of wiggly and noisy at times but was that enough? The doctor just laughed and said that if I were getting as much exercise for my size as she was for hers I'd be physically exhausted. About a week after Sara was born, our downstairs neighbor, Marian Fox delivered a boy at the same hospital. So now Ruth and Marian had each other to consult with and compare notes. One day Ruth wanted to do some shopping nearby so left Sara in my care. Boy was that a disaster for me. Sara upchucked, pooped and wee wee-d one after the other. I think she was enjoying my consternation and even added some vocal gymnastics to further unnerve me. My father, Sara's grandfather, Earl Peoples was with the Veteran's Administration in Chicago at the time of her birth. So proud grandpa was able to visit us and hold his first grandchild As she grew, month by month, we took Sara on baby carriage strolls through the nearby tunnel under Outer Drive and to a park along the lakeshore. One day in front of our apartment we saw a little girl about three years old who was walking along the street totally naked. We asked her if she was lost and she said \"No I have my purse with me\". About then her frantic mother came out of an apartment next door. I forget how old Sara was when one evening we went out for a summer evening drive. Somewhere along the way she threw the darnedest screaming tantrum while people in nearby vehicles looked at us like we were beating her. It was downright embarrassing for both of us. Finally, with Ruth's concurrence, I pulled over and went into a restaurant and got a glass of ice cold water. Then I came back to the car and doused Sara with it. She snapped out of the tantrum immediately. Sorry, Sara, but that was the only way we could shut you up. Because of his service connected disability my father had to periodically stay a few days at the nearby Veteran's Hospital for tests and observation. The first time I visited him at the hospital I got lost and ended up in a women's ward. I was shocked to find that this was a ward for women of WWI. Most were nurses from that war. After a few days in the hospital Earl would return to his job with the Veteran's Administration where he was in charge of the job training program and disability program for veterans. He became pretty good at cutting red tape for disabled veterans even by drastically bending some of the rules if he had to help a deserving veteran. Introduction to the Lennox Furnace Company In 1948, after a year and a half on the job with the Century Indemnity Company, I decided on a career in the heating industry. My rational was that the industry was still in the horse and buggy stage and that I could make use of my training in fluid mechanics, heat transfer and combustion. Besides, at the time I was making only $210 per month. The first company to come to mind was the Holland Furnace Company. Then my dad, Art Holt, whose insurance company wrote some of the Lennox insurance coverage, suggested that I consider Lennox, which was the leader in the warm air heating industry. Dad arranged an interview with the Lennox treasurer, Ted booth, who then brought in the president, John Norris. John asked me what kind of work I'd like to do and I told him I'd like to rotate through several departments but end up in Research and Development. I was hired, at a quantum leap to $300 per month, and was first assigned to the merchandising department. Since I'd flown in from Chicago for the interview, I inquired about the availability of housing. Ted told me about the Lennox Addition which was a housing development funded by the Marshalltown Foundry division of Lennox. The homes were brick two-bedroom structures with full basement and expandable attic. Ted said that there was one left if I'd be interested. We drove out to the house but Ted didn't have a key so we just looked in the windows. Since the house sold for $7,600 with zero to $700 down and $54 per month payment I decided to snap it up if I could arrange financing. Ted told me that I should contact Pat Haley who was president of the General Mortgage Company in Des Moines and who handled most of the Lennox Addition home financing. When I told dad about this he said that Pat Haley was a good friend of his ad that I should say that my dad, Art Holt, sent me to him. When I told Pat that he replied \"That's the first mistake you made in applying for this loan, Graydon\" and then he had a good laugh, thank goodness. Anyway I put $300 down and mortgaged the rest. The payments were $54 per month, which included principle, interest and insurance. When I returned to Chicago and told Ruth that I'd accepted the job and bought a house she asked me what the house was like inside. I had to admit that I hadn't been inside. She thought I'd lost my marbles. By the way, those brick houses were sold for cost plus $100, which was part of a contingency fund to take care of initial repairs that might be needed. The houses were available on a first-come- first-served basis to Lennox employee veterans first, Lennox employee non-veterans second and non-Lennox veterans third. Of course they were equipped with Lennox oil fired furnaces. These were small brick houses, about 24 feet wide and some 36 feet deep with full basement and expandable attic. The small front porch entryway led directly into the living room on the right. To the left of the living room was the kitchen-dinette combination. Behind the kitchen was the side door entryway and stairs leading to the basement. At the rear of the house were two bedrooms, a bathroom and door leading to a stairway to the big expandable attic. It was pure luxury compared to the apartment and just perfect for our small family of three. The Lennox Addition nestled up to the East end of the factory complex so the employees had two or three blocks to walk to work at the most. This was great for me since I had to give up my company car at Century Indemnity when I left. We could use our Century cars for personal travel so I never did have an incentive to own my own, nor in fact could I afford to. The Marshalltown City bus ran by our 16\" Avenue house, at that time, so getting into town wasn't a problem either. One day I was returning home on the bus when a couple behind me remarked about the terrible price people had to pay for the Lennox Addition houses. I turned around and said \"You must never have lived in Chicago where a house like these go for twice the price\" and then got off and walked up to my door. Our New Neighborhood After moving in I discovered that many of my neighbors were fellow Lennox employees. They included Harold Bragg, later factory and then general manager; Don Vreeland, chief engineer of Bettendorf burners; Kenny Kracht, chief photographer; Ray Champion, advertising manager; John Greiner; laboratory administrator; Tom McRae, assistant to Harold; Don O'Neal, tin shop manager; Joe Haunsperger; tool and die maker; and Harold Gummert, president of the furnace workers union. We were all starting our families and therefore had much in common besides working for Lennox. This association created a superb working management and employee team to the benefit of Lennox during those most important development years. We also had an interesting mix of neighbors who were not connected with Lennox. These included Kenny Hartstein, a scrap dealer; Ray Herzog, A Fisher Controls engineer and Jack Kuhl, a U.S. Gypsum sales engineer and Roosevelt High classmate of mine. These other neighbors were real handy to have around when we had special projects going that drew on their expertise and even their access to materials at special prices. Since all of the houses were new, the landscaping was minimal and there were no backyard fences so we had one long common backyard the length of the block. Many of us set up back yard games which were available to all neighbors. Braggs had croquet, Kracht's had a volley ball setup and I had horse-shoes. In fact we competed with each other for players. Bo Bragg, Harold's wife, would go around the neighborhood with a can of beer in each hand recruiting croquet players. My problem was that the novice horseshoe pitchers would more often ring my tomato plants than the hoses-shoe stake. We all made our contribution to the baby boom. On our block alone the tally ultimately reached an average of 2 kids per household. Many of us attributed this to living between the railroad lines - one north to serve Lennox and the power plant, and the Northwestern Line further to the south. Those late night trains did occasionally interrupt one's sleep. Arrival of Rob Sometime in 1950 Ruth became pregnant again. Let's see, I think it was nine minth before December 23, 1950, which would have been March 23. Boy how's that for my good memory? We'd heard that the second delivery comes a lot faster than the first ones so we were fully prepared for a rush to the hospital the moment contractions started. Fortunately the Marshalltown hospital was only about a mile and a half from the house. When contractions did start on the evening of December 23, we told one of our neighbors who had volunteered transportation, and high tailed it to the hospital. Late that night Ruth popped forth with a bouncing baby boy. He was so bouncing and long that he twice kicked the nameplate off his hospital bassinet. But we always knew which one he was because he was the loudest, most active baby in the whole hospital baby department. We named him Robert Graydon Peoples. Right off the bat we nicknamed him Rob because that less formal moniker seemed to better fit his outgoing personality. Since we had only two bedrooms we took Rob into ours for the first few months and then after he decided not to wake up and get hungry in the middle of the night we shifted him to Sara's room. So for now she had a roommate. The two of them seemed to hit it off right off the bat. Rob became a real crib shaker. He'd stand up in the crib, grab onto the end of it and shake it back and forth as hard as he could. It made quite a racket. One day some workmen from Lennox were in our basement installing some experimental piping on the furnace which was directly under Sara's and Rob's bedroom. Rob decided he needed some exercise and really shook the crib back and forth. Later, when I went down stairs to see how they were doing they looked at me with a grin and asked me what was going on up there. I'm not sure that they bought my explanation. Arrival of Schnapps Sara, even at her young age, became a great help with Rob and a good companion for him and he for her. About that time we decided that both of them needed another companion so we went small dog hunting. We visited a kennel near town. As we walked along the kennels many of the dogs yelped and begged to be adopted. One in particular pulled at our hearts. He was a cute little shorthaired brown Dachshund. He was purebred but we decided not to register him since he would only be our pet and companion. However, since he was of German descent we named him Schnapps Von Ketch. He had a bubbly and loving personality. So now we were a family of five. For the children the whole neighborhood became their playground and it was loaded with like age playmates. One day I looked out our window and saw the little Jewish Hartstein girl and the little Catholic Kuhl girl walking down the street dressed in Nun's habits. Kenny Hartstein just about broke up laughing. And talking about streets, our curbs and gutters were in but the street itself was gravel and quite dusty. We decided to petition the city council for paving and I was elected to go around the entire project to obtain signatures on the petition. It was a fabulous way to become acquainted with people on the other streets. Our committee then presented the petition to the city council, which dragged its feet for about a year before finally giving in to providing asphalt. In the meantime I was asked to run for city council but after a year of watching it operate I decided that my time would be better spent between Lennox and my growing family. However, I kept going to the council meeting since they were the best free show in town including the comedy nights. I got tired of depending on the bus for transportation and mentioned this to Kenny Hartstein one day. He said \"Graydon, I have just the car for you\" . Come on up to my scrap yard in Grundy Center and take a look at it. I'll sell it to you for 95 dollars.\" So I went up with Kenny and drove home in a mint condition, four-door Model A with window shades and even the thermometer radiator ornament. I wish I had it today. It was my first car and one I had fun driving and the neighbors had fun riding in. After about a year I sold it for my original $95 and bought a new Plymouth Crandbrook four door sedan. That was my first new car. Here comes Ruth Ann It was about this time that Ruth somehow got pregnant again. Nine months later we headed for the hospital in our own car. Ruth had a roommate who also was about to deliver. However, both gals slowed down so it appeared that it would be a long night before either got around to delivering. Her husband and I decided to go across the street from the hospital for a cup of coffee and to bring something back for the gals. We must have been gone for maybe 20 minutes. When we returned he was greeted with the news that he had a new baby boy. Ruth was still loafing along. Later the night, always late at night it seemed, Ruth's contractions started in earnest and early in the morning when she delivered a baby girl. It was September 25, 1953. We had decided that if it were a girl we'd name her after Ruth but instead of the middle name Marie we'd name her Ruth Ann so she wouldn't become junior. After we got her home we at first kept her in a little basket which had handles on it and allowed us to carry her around the house with us when she wasn't in her crib. One day the basket was setting on the couch when I looked in and there was Schnapps snuggled in beside her. I called Ruth to come look-see and she about had a fit. I guess it wasn't supposed to be a sanitary way to treat a baby. Anyway I always said that that incident instilled in Ruth Ann her love of animals. Now we were a family of six, including Schnapps, and bursting at the seams so we decided to expand the attic and build in two more upstairs bedrooms and a bath. This would require building a dormer at the back of the attic to provide more room and windows. I had a local contractor come out and give me advice and an estimate of the cost. He suggested that instead of a rear dormer we raise the outer edge of the entire rear roof with it hinged at the ridgeline. Then we'd build a rear second floor wall to support the outer part of the roof. This we did. Oh, I should mention that about a year earlier Dad and Mother decided to sell their house and move into an apartment on Grand Avenue in Des Moines. Dad said that he'd pay to floor our attic if we'd take some of their excess furniture off their hands. It sounded like a good deal and gave us some furniture for future needs. So when we raised the roof we already had a floored attic. We finished the two upstairs bedrooms but never did get around to completing the second bathroom. However, this gave us the expansion room we needed. I forget who moved upstairs but I think it was Sara and Rob. (Do either of you remember? In fact you may now have been old enough to help me with my memory and fill in some of the blank spaces in this narrative.) About this time John Greiner had decided to sell his Lennox Addition house and to build a new one in the new Elmwood Acres addition to Marshalltown, near the Golf and Country Club. He had made a neat overhead over his side door. I talked him into buying it from him and moved it to our side door so now we had kind of a rain shelter for that door. Mother and Dad often drove to Marshalltown for a visit with us and especially to see their grandchildren. In return we visited them at their apartment in Des Moines. Mother delighted in taking Sara and Rob to the park and Art Museums. As I remember, Ruth Ann was still too young for these excursions but Mother and Dad made up for it as she grew older. About this time I decided that we were outgrowing our little house and started looking at the possibility of following John Greiner's example and looking for a lot to build on in the Elmwood Acres addition. We did find one wooded one-acre lot that looked just right. I mentioned to Whit Whitcombe what I had in mind. Then he told me that he was building a house at Elmwood Acres and that his house on 10*™ Street was up for sale if I was interested. I visited his big old house and decided that if we could agree on a price it would be just perfect for us. We could avoid the hassle of building, we could move in immediately when purchased and it was closer to elementary and junior high schools than Elmwood Acres was. Whit and we agreed on a price of $18,000 for his house and since he wasn't in a hurry we made it contingent on selling our house. We listed and advertised our house for the then going rate of $14,000 and within the month had sold it for an even $14,000. This was a nice profit from the $7,600 we'd paid for it. The 10th Street house had a huge front porch, a mammouth living room across the full width of the front of the house joined by a little study alcove, a full sized dining room, a huge kitchen and dinette at the rear overlooking the back yard and a paneled study which could double as a bedroom behind the living room and a bathroom. This was all on the first floor. The second floor had one large master bedroom, two smaller bedrooms and a full bath. Along with this were oodles of storage space for each room and under the eaves. Finally there was a full basement for Laundry and recreational activities. The rear yard was spacious and at the end of the driveway beside the house was a single car garage that also had room for storage. I forget the date that we moved into the new old house but it was sure a treat. All that extra furniture that Mother and Dad had us store in our old attic easily found a place in the new house. This included a swan couch and a nice wicker furniture set for the enclosed front porch. Not much later, I was down at the local Ace hardware store to purchase a bag of nails for some project. I mentioned to the owner that not having television sure made it easier to get some of these projects going. Then he told me that they were having a terrific sale of television sets in their basement appliance department. I went down stairs and took a look. One big beautiful cabinet set with closing doors struck me as being a great addition to our living room. The price couldn't be beat, though I don't remember the figure, so I purchased it and had it delivered to the house. There was already an antenna on the roof Whit had left so no problem in hooking it up. That evening we all gathered around the set and enjoyed an evening of entertainment. Arrival of Edward Somewhere along the line Ruth became pregnant again. This time things didn't turn out so well. When the baby boy was born he had spina bifida and the doctor said that it might be only a matter of months that he had to live and that he would need constant nursing care in the meantime. We named him Edward. We agonized on how to cope with this situation in view of our lack of nursing expertise and responsibility to the other three children. The we heard of the Iowa State Woodward Children's Hospital in Woodward, Iowa. While Edward was still in the Marshalltown hospital we traveled to Woodward to check the hospital out. We were extremely impressed with the care being given the children, some of whom were in the same condition of Edward and many infants in the nursery. It was with heavy heart that we decided that this would provide Edward with the best care he could get. So we moved him there. We made many trips to Woodward to visit him and take him some little toys. In about nine months we got word that Edward had died. Mother and Dad came to Marshalltown for a brief service by our minister and we all traveled to Riverside Cemetery for his burial. I went to work around the house and yard. I put in a swing set in the side yard and built a playhouse in the back yard. I also re-paneled the dining room and we had the kitchen redone with ceramic tile above the counters. I remember finding some of the original house blueprints in the dining room stud spaces when I removed the old original paneling. Then we purchased a new dining room set made of ash. We figured that if ash was good enough for baseball bats it ought to stand up to the rigors of a growing family. The table had a number of leaves, which allowed it to seat twelve or fourteen people. The chairs were also ash and had padded fabric seats. Two of the chairs had armrests. Mother and Dad found a couple of matching chairs somewhere and brought them to add to our collection. Trip to West Virginia One summer we decided to take Sara, Rob and Ruth Ann for a visit to Ruth's family farm in West Virginia and to visit her brother Caesar and his wife, who was a close friend of Ruth's. It was several days drive so we moteled it along the way. Somewhere I have several pictures of our motel stops and the children saying their prayers before going to bed. Ruth's dad had died before our visit but her brothers and their wives had taken over the farm. The children loved riding the ponies but had to get used to the outhouse. I remember Ruth Ann getting a bath in the kitchen sink. I also have pictures of these events somewhere in storage. Now back to Marshalltown. During the summer months we began to do some camping with the children at nearby parks and at Clear Lake, Iowa. We also traded the Plymouth in on a ford Station wagon. I bought a tent to add a room to the back of the station wagon. It attached to the tailgate opening so some could sleep in the station wagon while others slept in the tent section on the ground. I took Rob and Sara for the first trial run of this new station wagon/tent combination to a nearby park. That night it rained and rained. Unfortunately the tailfins on the station wagon collected water which then drained directly into the tent. I forget who was sleeping in the tent part but I'm sure they were unhappy campers. We did away with the add-on tent and replaced it with a large wall tent and one or two pup tents. We started to do more and more tent camping a spent one summer at Lake of the Ozarks, with which we fell in love. Art Joins the Family About this time Art was in the incubator and popped forth on November 30, 1954. We named him Arthur, after dad Art Holt and Wilson, for Ruth's maiden name. I remember the trip to the Marshalltown Hospital very vividly. There were two of us in the prospective father's lounge. The other fellow was a young man who was expecting father hood for the first time. He was a nervous wreck. So experienced me took on the roll of counselor, advisor and psychiatrist. In fact I had him lay down on the couch while I was telling him about the joys of fatherhood and tried to assure him that his wife was going to be OK. One weekend, when Art was still in diapers, we decided to go camping for the weekend at Clear Lake, Iowa. Just Ruth, Sara, Rob, Ruth Ann and I went camping leaving Art with a lady baby sitter. The first night we all missed Art so much that we decided never again to leave any of the kids home when we went camping. The next time we went camping at Clear Lake we took Art along. As each new arrival joined the Peoples family the other kids were a wonderful help, especially when camping. On this trip we were tent camped next to three guys who decided to have a night on the town. They came rolling into the campground about three AM, making all kinds of noise and waking up everyone around them. Then at 6 AM, when we awoke, we considered pinching Art to get him crying and waking up those guys in retaliation. Art, we resisted doing the dastardly deed. Welcome Diane Next came little Diane on May 19, 1958. By this time Ruth and I were experienced at knowing the ropes to parenthood, when to head for the hospital and the shortest route between home and there. We had already decided that if it were a girl we'd name her Diane and if a boy we'd name him Don. Well, Don, Diane beat you that time. As I may have mentioned earlier, Ruth had monocular vision, sometimes called lazy eye. One eye was dominant while the other was a lazy eye, which sometime wandered, especially if Ruth was fatigued. We immediately noticed that Diane had inherited this lazy eye gene from Ruth. Fortunately the Wolfe Eye Clinic was located near the hospital so we had Dr. Oatis Wolfe check Diane out. He told us that this condition could be corrected with surgery but advised us to wait until Diane was two or three years old to do the procedure. It was not advisable for Ruth to have this procedure because of her age and the eye muscles had become so set by that time, besides Ruth had adapted to compensating for it, to some extent. When Diane became three years old Dr. Wolfe performed the eye muscle surgery and placed an eye patch over Diane's good eye to train the lazy eye. It worked and Diane became Dr. Wolfe's darling little patient. Finally Don Joins the Gang Finally on September 23, 1959 along came Don so now we could use the name Donald. We decided that his middle name should be Whitney so when he became a successful businessman in later life he could go by the name D. Whitney Peoples if he so chose. Boy was he ever in for a surprise with five brothers and sisters to cope with. Everyone adored Don and vied for the privilege of holding him, feeding him and spoiling him. Don never lacked for attention. When we went camping or, later, boating we never left Don behind. He was always the center of attention and had a brother or sister at close hand to play with him or even change him. The Arrival of a Boat One day I was in Joe Giles Camera Shop for some film and got to talking with Joe about boats. Since he was also a boat dealer he had a few boats behind his shop. He had one in particular that he wanted to sell to make room for some new merchandise coming in. He'd had it in stock for a long time and it was also costing him money each month. The boat was a 17 foot white wooden lapstrake Dunphy Wayfarer model. Joe made me a great price on the boat. After talking this over with Ruth we decided that this would be a great addition for our summer vacations and some weekends on nearby lakes. I don't think she was as gung ho to buy the boat as I was since she didn't even know how to swim. I must have persuaded her that it would be great for our whole family and especially the children and add a new dimension to our camping and vacations. Joe was so happy to make the sale that under an impulse he reached under his camera counter, pulled out a Stereo Realist camera and handed it to me as a gift. After tossing around a number of names for the boat I got to thinking about how we could get the girl's names into it. I wrote down Sara's, Ruth's and Diane's names on a piece of paper. Suddenly it popped out clear as day, SaRuDi. The vote was unanimous and SaRuDi it became and the name was placed on the boat. SaRuDi opened up a whole new world of adventure for us. We could now combine camping with boating and it could lead to water skiing, fishing and just exploring many lakes and rivers. Some of our favorite spots that we returned to many times were Clear Lake in Iowa, Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri and then the Mississippi River and it's many sand barred shores and Green Bay and Door County in Wisconsin. Now back to Lennox and my experiences there Merchandising Assignment My first assignment with the Lennox Furnace Company was in the merchandising department under the direction of Bud Moen. I remember that one of our assigned tasks was the development of a new logo and trademark for Lennox. My stay in the department was very brief but I felt that I somehow made a little contribution to what later became the Lennox logo, which still is used to this day. The stint under Bud did provide me with a better insight into the marketing end of Lennox and an appreciation for the superb dealer organization, which Lennox had created under John Norris. At that time Lennox did very little national advertising but depended on this dealer organization and word of mouth advertising to create a demand for Lennox products and services. However, about the time of my arrival Lennox had hired Ray Champion to create a national advertising program and promote the Lennox name recognition nationally. Plan Engineering Department My next assignment was in the Plan Engineering Department under Barney Phipps. Here I learned how design warm air heating systems. Our bible was the book \"Warm Air Heating and Winter Air Conditioning\" by John Norris, Sr. I still have my mint condition copy which is my reference even now, when I need tables or other information. The Plan Engineering experience was invaluable to me during the many years that followed in Research and Development, since the furnace distribution system and all of its components must function properly and efficiently as a unit. Plan Engineering was a service provided to the dealer in designing, drawing, specifying and pricing complete systems. It was intended to provide this service for the more complex commercial applications but many of our jobs were also residential. Since Wisconsin had more stringent regulations regarding ventilation we were divided into two groups. One handled Wisconsin jobs and the other handled all other jobs. Dorothy Ford, who was the daughter of the owner of our local Ford Greenhouses, was assigned to do Wisconsin jobs full time. She was our expert plan engineer. A high percentage of our assignments involved churches or schools. These created challenges to meet not only ventilation needs but also drastic changes in occupancy and consequently in the heating loads. Another challenge was to locate and size registers to provide proper air distribution without creating objectionable drafts. This was especially challenging in churches with high ceilings. I remember one Texas church job that was assigned to me. After doing the load calculations, sizing the furnace and laying out the duct system I realized that the furnace room, provided on the architect's drawing, was too small for the furnace. I called the architect who told me that the building was already under construction and the furnace room was completed. They had to do some pretty expensive modifications. This was my first lesson about things that can go wrong when the architect or prime contractor fails to monitor the schedules of the subcontrators. My second experience involved the Armstrong plant in Des Moines. We were assigned the sizing and system design for the office section of the plant, which was under construction. The supply system was overhead but the return air ducts were designed to run beneath the concrete floor slab. After completing the system design, Barney Phipps and I headed for Des Moines with the blueprints. When we walked into the building they were just finishing trowling off the concrete which had been poured just before our arrival. Our only alternative was to place return air grills in the hallway wall next to the furnace room and suck the air down the hallway from underneath the various doors. People who walked to close to the return air grills got a real draft, especially the girls with loose skirts. Many dealers were competent in the design of residential systems but I think some just found it easier and less risky to pass the responsibility on to us. Others, especially the small dealers, just didn't possess the expertise. In later years our dealer training programs addressed this need. A typical forced warm air residential system, in those days, consisted of a trunk duct across the basement ceiling with takeoffs to risers which went up inside the stud spaces to inside high sidewall registers. The central return air registers were located in the baseboard or floor, close to the furnace location below. I should add that we also did layouts for gravity systems where the warm air rose by gravity from the top of the furnace to the upper floor(s) through large ducts and registers. Colder air returned to the bottom of the furnace through large ducts and grills in the floor. A properly designed gravity system just couldn't be beat. Our biggest challenge was to find a stud space unoccupied by another contractor's wiring or plumbing. It seemed that he who got there first got the stud space. This was another example of the importance of the architect or general contractor to keep each of us out of the other's way. Move to Research and Development After three or four months in Merchandising and Plan Engineering I was ready to move on to my final assignment in the Research and Development Department. R&D was located in an area off the steel shop and about halfway back in one of the row of separate shop buildings. To reach the R&D laboratory (lab) we had to enter through the steel shop where a sliding door led into the lab. We had no exterior door but did have a continual row of window overlooking the road between the buildings. This provided excellent light for our work. We had a large open space where we could assemble, instrument and test the coal, gas and oil fired furnaces. Steel- topped workbenches ran the full length of the lab and were located under the row of windows. At the rear of the lab was a large coal storage room, which was equipped with a refrigerator-like door to keep the coal dust out of the lab. The offices and drafting room were located at the front of the lab near the sliding entrance door. There was a row of two-man engineer's offices with windows overlooking the lab test floor. In fact there were windows on all three sides of each office so we could even communicate with hand signals if needed. Frank Alexander shared an office with me. One afternoon, about 4:30 PM we noticed that one of the engineers had his head down on his desk and was sound asleep. At 5:00 PM quitting time we all quietly tiptoed out of the lab without waking him up. The next day we learned that he had slept until 7;00 PM and boy was he ever mad at us for not waking him up. Some of us would bring our golf clubs to work so we could head directly to the golf course after work. Blaine Vandeventer had a full set of clubs in a beautiful big bag and always complained about the weight. This gave us and idea. Each day we would sneak a small piece of cast iron into the bottom of his golf bag and then replace the clubs. After a couple of weeks Blaine really started complaining until one day he discovered the pieces of iron and flame spreaders and dumped them out. He did get a laugh with the rest of us and never again complained about the weight of his bag and clubs. At one time we had problems with unannounced guest Lennox dealers or our own salesmen visiting the lab and then sometimes going out and selling products before they had been released for production. Sometimes the product was never released. So we posted a \"No Admittance\" sign on the steel shop side of the door. The next day we came into the lab to discover that the steel shop had posted a \"No Admittance\" sign on our side of the door leading into their shop. Since this was our only exit from the lab, we had to ignore the sign but always got reminded of it from the guys in the steel shop. The entire lab crew consisted of about 13 men including our supervisor, Marvin Stark; Project Engineers Graham Dodds, Frank Alexander, Warren Eichorn, Blaine Vandeventer and me; Lab Administrator John Greiner; Drafsman Buzz Bowers; Lab Technicians Red Boles and Oliver Jordt; and a Janitor Fred Haines. There was also one other project engineer whose name I can't remember but who later left the company to study medicine and became a medical missionary. Projects under way at that time involved the Fellows smokeless coal furnace, conversion burners for existing coal fired furnaces, some work on gravity vaporizing pot oil furnaces and a new line of horizontal gas furnaces designated as the A2 (for Attic) series. We also did development work on oil burners for the Armstrong Furnace company, which was also owned by the Norris family . had been with the lab for about three weeks, working on some oil projects, when Marv Stark asked me to join him for a trip to the American Gas Association Laboratories (AGA) in Cleveland, Ohio. He said we'd be gone for about three days so I packed accordingly. I had no idea of the purpose of the trip except that Marv wanted to get me acquainted with the AGA operation and procedures. When we arrived I learned that Marv had shipped a couple of A2s to AGA for test and certification. At the time I was totally unfamiliar with the A2 but welcomed the chance to learn about it under Marv's guidance. After three days we got the units set up and instrumented and were about to have the AGA technician begin the testing. We weren't allowed to be present during the tests but were to be called in to take corrective action in case the unit failed a test. At this time Marv announced that he was returning to Marshalltown and that I was to take over. This news came as a total shock to me since I wasn't familiar with the furnace. However I assumed that it was just a formality to have a company representative present and that the furnace had been thoroughly pretested and would go through the AGA test without any problems or need for my lack of expertise. I then called home to have more clothes sent to me. My home in Cleveland was a hotel, which straddled the rail station. I forget the name. I guessed that I might be there another week or week and a half. As it turned out I was there for seven weeks working to modify the A2 so it would pass, and then having some more units shipped to AGA for me to shepherd through. It became a terrific learning experience for me. I think the AGA engineers felt sorry for me because they took me under their wings and taught me a lot about gas combustion and gas furnace testing and gave me free reign of the test floor. In fact before it was all over I was a full time member of one of the AGA bowling teams. I also was occasionally invited to some of the engineer's homes for dinner. After each day's testing I wrote a detailed summary and mailed it to Marv. Numerous times I had to pull the A2 off the test floor and take it to a manufacturer's room where I could work on modifications to overcome the failures and test the fixes out. A serious flaw was a lack of space and air movement between the heat exchanger, inner liner and cabinet. The result was that the cabinet surface overheated, discolored and became a fire hazard. I had to have new panels made up in Marshalltown and shipped to me. One of the discoveries I made was that when one problem is solved it might change parameters that create other problems. This was the case with the A2 One day I was on my back, working under the furnace, when I noticed a group of legs walking into the room. Then I heard the voice of a tour guide explain, \"And this is where the manufacturer brings his equipment for work after it fails our tests.\" After they left I crawled out from under and relieved to see that the Lennox logo was facing away from the door. While at AGA I met two other manufacturer's engineers who were also stuck in Cleveland like me. One was Jas Reznor of the Reznor Unit Heater Company and the other was Ralph Ford of Duotherm. Jas was the only one with a car so the three of us decided to use the car to become acquainted with Cleveland, its restaurants and cultural attractions during the weekends. Jas and I kidded Ralph about his Chippendale and Hepplewhite space heaters. Anyway we became close friends during our mutual trials and tribulations at AGA. I discovered that some companies sent in products for testing but rather than send along the project engineer or technician, the President or Chief Engineer would come along for the ride thinking the equipment would sail through while the top brass did the town and enjoyed a company paid mini vacation. One such executive who encountered a test failure came to me and asked if he could borrow my carbon monoxide tester. I lent it to him on the condition that he'd replace the test cartridge. About an hour later he came back and sheepishly asked me to show him how it worked Finally I called Marv and told him that I thought we were spinning our wheels with the A2 and that it and I should return to Marshalltown. Instead he sent Warren Eichorn in to replace me. When Warren arrived I asked him if he had read my daily reports to Marv. I was astounded when Warren replied \"What reports?\". I returned home and two days later Warren reported that there was no way the A2 could get through AGA. Marv then had it shipped back to the lab. It was then that I was called into Marv's office for a meeting with John Norris and Roger Booth. Suddenly it dawned on me that Marv was using me to cover up for himself. 1 let it ride but never trusted Marv after that and figured someday he would sink himself which he ultimately did. However I treated the whole episode as a fantastic learning experience which did serve me well in the years that followed After the return to the lab I went back to work on oil burner related projects. The most interesting ones were involved with the development and testing of conversion oil burners for coal furnaces ranging from residential size to the SS 1000 mammoth units. The SS1000 had a walk-in size primary heat exchanger with a secondary exchanger on each side. Most furnaces in those days were knocked down and had to be assembled on site because they were too large to pass through a doorway. Such were the coal furnaces. To brick up the combustion chamber in the SS1000 one worked standing up inside the primary heat exchanger lay up the bricks. One day I was in there when one of the other engineers walked by with a ball peen hammer in his hand and without knowing I was inside gave a good whack on the heat exchanger. Needless to say I came sailing out like I'd been in a bass drum with my head ringing in and out. In later years I attributed that to my partial hearing loss. Each of the project engineers was not only involved in the design of the furnace or burner but also in the fabrication of the prototype unit and then the testing of it.. He could draw on the services of other departments such as the tin shop, tool and die shop or body shop since we didn't have our own model shop until years later. Also he could utilize the services of one of the technicians but was responsible for every step in the process. This experience became especially valuable in working with the production people and ironing out production problems and pitfalls. It also created in each engineer a better appreciation and understanding of production limitations and tooling. One of our own lab limitations during, those early years, was that we each had to provide our own hand tools. Test equipment and heavy tools were provided by Lennox but the screwdrivers, wrenches and the like were the responsibility of the engineer. Only one guy in the lab had a complete collection of tools and that was Red boles. He was generous in the lending of tools which we didn't have in our own tool box and we always saw that he got his back in a timely manner and clean. When Red was transferred out of the lab, testing really slowed down until some of us went out and bought our own hand tools. We occasionally had a problem with someone coming into the lab from another department and asking us to do this or do that. Sometimes it was disruptive to other projects. One day John Norris found out about this and instructed us to respond by telling the person demanding the service to \"Go to Hell\" '. One day Red was welding something when John Norris tapped him on the shoulder and submitted a request. Red raised his welding mask, turned to John and said, \"Go to Hell\". John then remembered his instructions to us and had a big laugh. That was the kind of warm person he was. I had heard that in John's younger years his dad had him work every job in the factory from floor sweeper on up the line. After John returned with his engineering degree from MIT I heard stories about how he and F.H. (Whit) Whitcombe did experimental work on innovations on the QT since his dad might not approve. Some of this, so I heard, involved the adaptation of blowers to gravity furnaces. Even after he later became president, John could walk through the factory and address most of the employees by name. They all seemed to address him simply as \"John\". He did spend a lot of time out on the floor and with visits to our lab so he had his hand constantly on the pulse of Lennox operations ranging from design to production to marketing and dealer sales. John's door was always open to all and as often as not he answered his own phone. Whether there was a design or production problem to be resolved which called for a decision by John, or he had a request to be passed down, the lines of communication were short and always open. We in the lab could seek a decision and, with a visit to his office or a phone call, obtain one and act on it immediately. Often because of this a small problem could be resolved before it grew into a large one. John encouraged this same direct communication among departments and with our sales and dealer organizations. John was always friendly and pleasant and didn't stand much for the formal organizational hierarchy of some companies. One day Marion Free and I were meeting in our lab conference room to go over some control circuit designs with a group of engineers from the Minneapolis Honeywell Company. John walked in to hang up his coat in the nearby closet. I said \"Hi John\" and we were about to resume our business when one of the Honeywell men said, \"When the president of our company walks into the room we all stand up\". To which John replied \"Bull S__, I'd rather see our men continue to work and be productive\". Our sales meetings in those days were fabulous, inspirational and great fun for everyone. I especially remember one at the Marshalltown Coliseum. This was called an international sales meeting since it included all divisions and sales territories from Texas to the new ones in Canada. You should have heard those Texans and Canadians trying to outdo each other with their stories. Some of the Canadians pointed out that their territories were bigger than all of Texas and had to be covered by every form of transportation including dog sled. Each of the divisions came dressed in clothes befitting their area. Of course the Texans came dressed in cowboy attire and ten-gallon hats and sported fully loaded cap pistols. Those from Minnesota came dressed in Paul Bunyon attire while those from the Salt Lake division wore gambler's eye shades. The ones from Iowa wore bib overalls. During the banquet the Texans weren't satisfied with sitting on chairs. They ate from saddles, which were mounted on sawhorses. The stage was filled with valuable merchandise including major appliances. An auction was held for the items of merchandise. As I recall, bidding was done on the basis of what percentage a salesman thought he could exceed his sales quota for the coming year. If he didn't meet his bid then he had to later pay for that percentage of the cost of the merchandise out of his own pocket. Some of the bidding was downright reckless but some of the territory managers were feeling little pain. Of course the main purpose of the sales meetings was to introduce new products and inspire the sales forces. From the R&D perspective this meant designing, testing, getting AGA or UL listing and releasing to production new products in time for the annual sales meeting. These deadlines really put all of us in R&D to the test. Then when we attended these sales meetings we were inundated with questions and solicitations for assurances that the products would perform as claimed. We were also given earfuls of suggestions for product improvements and designs for improved serviceability. In fact many of the territory managers had the R&D engineers visit them and their dealers in the field to resolve sticky service problems and get first hand exposure to the real life in the field. I think this is what put Lenox in the forefront of the heating industry for so many years and kept us there. Another testament to this came later when I submitted oil equipment to Underwriter's Laboratories for test and certification. More than once, I made arrangements to provide Lennox furnaces to UL employees at something around dealer cost, which they willingly paid rather than accept free competitive equipment. Our oil burners were manufactured by the Bettendorf Oil Burner Company, which was also owned by the Norris family, and was located in a building within the Lennox compound. We worked closely with Bettendorf and especially Don Vreeland, their chief engineer, during the design and development process. Bettendorf also marketed its own line of burners to the heating industry. Most of our lab work was designing, fabricating and testing the firing heads or gun assemblies used with the various burner blower housings. This was as much an art as it was a science. We had to deal with so many interacting variables that there was no way to predict performance except by trial and error testing and getting a feel for what worked and what didn't. Sometimes we'd think we were on the right track and then couldn't get performance to repeat itself. Some of the variables were related to combustion blower design and effect of altitude, air density, temperature and relative humidity. Others had to do with delicacies of the nozzle design and manufacturing which affected spray types, spray angles and spray patterns. These had to be properly matched with the air patterns being discharged by the firing head. Then there was the design and sizing of the brick combustion chamber. And finally we had to contend with various oil types and specifications. I remember a meeting where someone asked one of the oil company representatives when they were going to settle on specifications for heating oils, which we could burn in our equipment. The answer was \"When are you going to design equipment which can burn our oils?\" '. The oil companies didn't provide the kind of support needed by the equipment manufacturer. They didn't seem to realize that our industry made a one-time sale of the equipment but that their stake was in a continuing sale of oil. This attitude is what allowed the natural gas industry to make inroads into the oil heating market. The oil companies didn't wake up until it was too late to retain their share of the heating market. Our industry was kind of divided into special interest segments. Some companies were fuel oriented. That is, some marketed oil burning fuel and products and therefore were oil oriented. Others marketed gas and gas burning equipment. Later there was the electric fuel group. At Lennox we marked product which would burn any fuel so we were not fuel oriented and could therefore participate with all of the fuel people. The other division was system orientation. At the time steam and hot water heating was common. These were \"wet heat people\". Lennox was \"warm air heat\" oriented and promoted the virtues of warm air heating, ventilation, distribution and filtration. This prepared us admirably for the later emergence of residential and commercial summer air conditioning. We were members of the National Warm Air Heating and Air-conditioning Association which served our warm air industry and underwrote research at the University of Illinois. The Association also worked with the US Department of commerce to develop industry performance standards for warm air systems as well as for furnaces and burners. John encouraged us to participate in the Association activities and I was able to serve on three or four of their committees and became chairman of the CS75 and CS195 committees for oil burners and furnaces. Merchandising Assignment My first assignment with the Lennox Furnace Company was in the merchandising department under the direction of Bud Moen. I remember that one of our assigned tasks was the development of a new logo and trademark for Lennox. My stay in the department was very brief but I felt that I somehow made a little contribution to what later became the Lennox logo, which still is used to this day. The stint under Bud did provide me with a better insight into the marketing end of Lennox and an appreciation for the superb dealer organization, which Lennox had created under John Norris. At that time Lennox did very little national advertising but depended on this dealer organization and word of mouth advertising to create a demand for Lennox products and services. However, about the time of my arrival Lennox had hired Ray Champion to create a national advertising program and promote the Lennox name recognition nationally. Plan Engineering Department My next assignment was in the Plan Engineering Department under Barney Phipps. Here I learned how design warm air heating systems. Our bible was the book \"Warm Air Heating and Winter Air Conditioning\" by John Norris, Sr. I still have my mint condition copy which is my reference even now, when I need tables or other information. The Plan Engineering experience was invaluable to me during the many years that followed in Research and Development, since the furnace distribution system and all of its components must function properly and efficiently as a unit. Plan Engineering was a service provided to the dealer in designing, drawing, specifying and pricing complete systems. It was intended to provide this service for the more complex commercial applications but many of our jobs were also residential. Since Wisconsin had more stringent regulations regarding ventilation we were divided into two groups. One handled Wisconsin jobs and the other handled all other jobs. Dorothy Ford, who was the daughter of the owner of our local Ford Greenhouses, was assigned to do Wisconsin jobs full time. She was our expert plan engineer. A high percentage of our assignments involved churches or schools. These created challenges to meet not only ventilation needs but also drastic changes in occupancy and consequently in the heating loads. Another challenge was to locate and size registers to provide proper air distribution without creating objectionable drafts. This was especially challenging in churches with high ceilings. I remember one Texas church job that was assigned to me. After doing the load calculations, sizing the furnace and laying out the duct system I realized that the furnace room, provided on the architect's drawing, was too small for the furnace. I called the architect who told me that the building was already under construction and the furnace room was completed. They had to do some pretty expensive modifications. This was my first lesson about things that can go wrong when the architect or prime contractor fails to monitor the schedules of the subcontrators. My second experience involved the Armstrong plant in Des Moines. We were assigned the sizing and system design for the office section of the plant, which was under construction. The supply system was overhead but the return air ducts were designed to run beneath the concrete floor slab. After completing the system design, Barney Phipps and I headed for Des Moines with the blueprints. When we walked into the building they were just finishing trowling off the concrete which had been poured just before our arrival. Our only alternative was to place return air grills in the hallway wall next to the furnace room and suck the air down the hallway from underneath the various doors. People who walked to close to the return air grills got a real draft, especially the girls with loose skirts. Many dealers were competent in the design of residential systems but I think some just found it easier and less risky to pass the responsibility on to us. Others, especially the small dealers, just didn't possess the expertise. In later years our dealer training programs addressed this need. A typical forced warm air residential system, in those days, consisted of a trunk duct across the basement ceiling with takeoffs to risers which went up inside the stud spaces to inside high sidewall registers. The central return air registers were located in the baseboard or floor, close to the furnace location below. I should add that we also did layouts for gravity systems where the warm air rose by gravity from the top of the furnace to the upper floors) through large ducts and registers. Colder air returned to the bottom of the furnace through large ducts and grills in the floor. A properly designed gravity system just couldn't be beat. Our biggest challenge was to find a stud space unoccupied by another contractor's wiring or plumbing. It seemed that he who got there first got the stud space. This was another example of the importance of the architect or general contractor to keep each of us out of the other's way. Move to Research and Development After three or four months in Merchandising and Plan Engineering I was ready to move on to my final assignment in the Research and Development Department. R&D was located in an area off the steel shop and about halfway back in one of the row of separate shop buildings. To reach the R&D laboratory (lab) we had to enter through the steel shop where a sliding door led into the lab. We had no exterior door but did have a continual row of window overlooking the road between the buildings. This provided excellent light for our work. We had a large open space where we could assemble, instrument and test the coal, gas and oil fired furnaces. Steel- topped workbenches ran the full length of the lab and were located under the row of windows. At the rear of the lab was a large coal storage room, which was equipped with a refrigerator-like door to keep the coal dust out of the lab. The offices and drafting room were located at the front of the lab near the sliding entrance door. There was a row of two-man engineer's offices with windows overlooking the lab test floor. In fact there were windows on all three sides of each office so we could even communicate with hand signals if needed. Frank Alexander shared an office with me. One afternoon, about 4:30 PM we noticed that one of the engineers had his head down on his desk and was sound asleep. At 5:00 PM quitting time we all quietly tiptoed out of the lab without waking him up. The next day we learned that he had slept until 7;00 PM and boy was he ever mad at us for not waking him up. Some of us would bring our golf clubs to work so we could head directly to the golf course after work. Blaine Vandeventer had a full set of clubs in a beautiful big bag and always complained about the weight. This gave us and idea. Each day we would sneak a small piece of cast iron into the bottom of his golf bag and then replace the clubs. After a couple of weeks Blaine really started complaining until one day he discovered the pieces of iron and flame spreaders and dumped them out. He did get a laugh with the rest of us and never again complained about the weight of his bag and clubs. At one time we had problems with unannounced guest Lennox dealers or our own salesmen visiting the lab and then sometimes going out and selling products before they had been released for production. Sometimes the product was never released. So we posted a \"No Admittance\" sign on the steel shop side of the door. The next day we came into the lab to discover that the steel shop had posted a \"No Admittance\" sign on our side of the door leading into their shop. Since this was our only exit from the lab, we had to ignore the sign but always got reminded of it from the guys in the steel shop. The entire lab crew consisted of about 13 men including our supervisor, Marvin Stark; Project Engineers Graham Dodds, Frank Alexander, Warren Eichorn, Blaine Vandeventer and me; Lab Administrator John Greiner; Drafsman Buzz Bowers; Lab Technicians Red Boles and Oliver Jordt; and a Janitor Fred Haines. There was also one other project engineer whose name I can't remember but who later left the company to study medicine and became a medical missionary. Projects under way at that time involved the Fellows smokeless coal furnace, conversion burners for existing coal fired furnaces, some work on gravity vaporizing pot oil furnaces and a new line of horizontal gas furnaces designated as the A2 (for Attic) series. We also did development work on oil burners for the Armstrong Furnace company, which was also owned by the Norris family. I had been with the lab for about three weeks, working on some oil projects, when Marv Stark asked me to join him for a trip to the American Gas Association Laboratories (AGA) in Cleveland, Ohio. He said we'd be gone for about three days so I packed accordingly. I had no idea of the purpose of the trip except that Marv wanted to get me acquainted with the AGA operation and procedures. When we arrived I learned that Marv had shipped a couple of A2s to AGA for test and certification. At the time I was totally unfamiliar with the A2 but welcomed the chance to learn about it under Marv's guidance. After three days we got the units set up and instrumented and were about to have the AGA technician begin the testing. We weren't allowed to be present during the tests but were to be called in to take corrective action in case the unit failed a test. At this time Marv announced that he was returning to Marshalltown and that I was to take over. This news came as a total shock to me since I wasn't familiar with the furnace. However I assumed that it was just a formality to have a company representative present and that the furnace had been thoroughly pretested and would go through the AGA test without any problems or need for my lack of expertise. I then called home to have more clothes sent to me. My home in Cleveland was a hotel, which straddled the rail station. I forget the name. I guessed that I might be there another week or week and a half. As it turned out I was there for seven weeks working to modify the A2 so it would pass, and then having some more units shipped to AGA for me to shepherd through. It became a terrific learning experience for me. I think the AGA engineers felt sorry for me because they took me under their wings and taught me a lot about gas combustion and gas furnace testing and gave me free reign of the test floor. In fact before it was all over I was a full time member of one of the AGA bowling teams. I also was occasionally invited to some of the engineer's homes for dinner. After each day's testing I wrote a detailed summary and mailed it to Marv. Numerous times I had to pull the A2 off the test floor and take it to a manufacturer's room where I could work on modifications to overcome the failures and test the fixes out. A serious flaw was a lack of space and air movement between the heat exchanger, inner liner and cabinet. The result was that the cabinet surface overheated, discolored and became a fire hazard. I had to have new panels made up in Marshalltown and shipped to me. One of the discoveries I made was that when one problem is solved it might change parameters that create other problems. This was the case with the A2 One day I was on my back, working under the furnace, when I noticed a group of legs walking into the room. Then I heard the voice of a tour guide explain, \"And this is where the manufacturer brings his equipment for work after it fails our tests.\" After they left I crawled out from under and relieved to see that the Lennox logo was facing away from the door. While at AGA I met two other manufacturer's engineers who were also stuck in Cleveland like me. One was Jas Reznor of the Reznor Unit Heater Company and the other was Ralph Ford of Duotherm. Jas was the only one with a car so the three of us decided to use the car to become acquainted with Cleveland, its restaurants and cultural attractions during the weekends. Jas and I kidded Ralph about his Chippendale and Hepplewhite space heaters. Anyway we became close friends during our mutual trials and tribulations at AGA.

When Warren arrived I asked him if he had read my daily reports to Marv. I was astounded when Warren replied \"What reports?\" I returned home and two days later Warren reported that there was no way the A2 could get through AGA. Marv then had it shipped back to the lab. It was then that I was called into Marv's office for a meeting with John Norris and Roger Booth. Suddenly it dawned on me that Marv was using me to cover up for himself.

I remember a meeting where someone asked one of the oil company representatives when they were going to settle on specifications for heating oils, which we could burn in our equipment.

We were members of the National Warm Air Heating and Air-conditioning Association which served our warm air industry and underwrote research at the University of Illinois. The Association also worked with the US Department of commerce to develop industry performance standards for warm air systems as well as for furnaces and burners. John encouraged us to participate in the Association activities and I was able to serve on three or four of their committees and became chairman of the CS75 and CS195 committees for oil burners and furnaces. I remember when electric baseboard and radiant heating was beginning to be popular and was making inroads into the warm air heating market. Some of our committee members were bemoaning electric heat as a competitive form of heat. I had to remind them that electricity wasn't another type of heating system but rather just another fuel, which we could use to our advantage in warm air heating. So we add electricity to coal, oil and gas as a fuel and began to develop standards for electric warm air heating equipment. The other type of standards that we needed to meet were the safety standard developed by Underwriter's Laboratories and American Gas Association Although UL had the power and authority to write and promulgate its own safety standard it drew on the expertise of the industries affected by setting up Industry Advisory Councils (IACs). I served on the IACs for Oil Burners, Oil fired Furnaces and Mobile Home Systems. UL also tested to the Commercial standards if the manufacturer requested it. Otherwise the manufacturer could self certify his equipment as meeting the Commercial Standard subject to check testing by the industry. Some of us preferred to have an independent testing laboratory such as UL do the testing to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. Other engineers at Lennox served on the AGA committees. It was through this type of industry participation that Lennox was able to keep abreast the latest developments and design equipment to both meet and exceed industry standards. When I joined the R&D Laboratory, one of the early furnaces I worked on was called an oil fired vaporizing pot gravity furnace. It didn't require any 120-volt electricity for its operation. The vaporizing pot burner was a kind of pot into which oil was metered by a float valve forming a small pool of burning oil. When there was no call for heat the flow was cut down to a trickle, which acted as a standing pilot light. At that time the oil companies used the thermal cracking method to produce the light grade oil used in the pot burners. So these pot burners were developed to burn that oil. Then, after WWIl the oil companies came up with a catalytic method for cracking their oil. It started to give us all kinds of headaches with our existing equipment in the field so I worked on trying to find ways to adapt the equipment to the new oil. We were partly successful but not completely, so the vaporizing pot market literally started to go to pot and we phased out production. The more complex and expensive gun burners then accelerated into the market. My job was the design and testing of oil burner gun assemblies for the Lennox oil burners. These were then manufactured by the Bettendorf division and some models were marked to the general trade under the Bettendorf name. Since some of the Bettendorf customers were hot water systems manufacturers the burners needed to be adaptable to hot water boilers. The only available boiler for testing the burners was the hot water heater in John Norris' house. So I spent many hours in his basement testing those burners. Since the boiler didn't have a front inspection door, I couldn't take an over-the-fire flue sample from that end of the boiler. Instead I had to fire up the burner, remove the rear breaching plate and then feed a long sampling probe down one of the horizontal boiler tubes until the end of the probe was over the fire. Most of the time, I worked alone doing these tests. However, one day Graham Dodds was with me while I was demonstrating a test to him. I turned on the burner and then removed the rear breaching and was feeding the probe down a boiler tube which was half full of soot when there was a blast. The burner had not ignited, so had been discharging raw oil vapor and then, BOOM, it took off. I took the blast full in the face. There were no burns but the soot blinded me. Graham filled the washbasin with water and ducked my head into it and then rushed me to the Wolfe Eye clinic. The senior Dr. Wolfe spent about an hour rolling back my eyelids and picking out the soot. Although I had on a shirt and tie, my skin was black with soot down to my belt line. We were lucky, though, that John's ironing lady had just removed all of the ironed linens from the table behind the boiler before the blast occurred. There were a lot of gravity coal furnaces in existence at the time so in addition to adding a blower to adapt the gravity furnace to forced warm air we developed conversion oil and gas burners to convert them from coal to gas or oil. At the same time we were moving rapidly ahead with the design and development of packaged oil and gas fired forced warm air furnaces, designed from the ground up. The early models of furnaces were too large to pass through a standard doorway so had to be assembled on the installation site. The packaged units were designed within dimensions that would allow them to be carried through a doorway. This cut down costs by keeping the assembly work in the factory where it could be done at less cost and more efficiently and with less chance for errors. One of the most popular oil fired furnaces of the time was the OF series, especially the OF4. This was a low boy series which had everything enclosed including the blower at the rear and the burner in a vestibule in the front. It was a beautiful two-tone brown and beige model with rounded corners on the top. It did require assembly on the job site. Furnace and burner sales were highly seasonal and fell off during summer months. For this reason the factory was shut down for two weeks each July and everyone had that time for vacation. In addition there was an attempt to keep the work-force occupied by manufacturing other products. One such project was the design and manufacture of aluminum holiday houses. These were aluminum structures where the parts were fabricated in the factory and then assembled on the site. The structures could be installed as a separate garage or a screened in entertainment center. The first prototype test house was built in the back yard of Harold Bragg, our factory manager. Harold recruited a few of us Lennox neighbors to help erect the Holiday House. Since it was raining off and on that day we'd take a break during the showers and retire to Harold's basement for some friendly poker. Then when it cleared up we'd go out to work some more. Well, Harold was in the hole in the poker game when we went out during a lull in the rain. The next time we came back to resume the game, Janie, Harold's daughter had put away the poker chips so we didn't know who owed who what. We never did let Harold live that one down. A couple of days later a wind storm came up, picked up the Holiday House and deposited it in pieces which were draped across cars in the nearby Foundry parking lot. After much analyses we discovered a weak joint in a hat section which had caused the failure. The problem was corrected and there were no more such failures from then on. There were other projects to fill in the slack summer months. One that I heard of was a card shuffler but I don't remember the details. Lennox management has always been safety conscious and had a safety engineer, Ed Connors, on its payroll. The R&D Lab held a record of no lost time accidents dating back to when safety records were kept. We were extremely proud of this record. One day our janitor, Fred Haines, had gone to one corner of the lab during lunch hour and took a nap on top of a horizontal furnace. He fell off and banged up a knee or elbow so Laura Goodale, our company nurse, sent him home. Since an employee has to be out for 24 hours to count as a lost time accident we told him that if he wasn't back to work the next morning wed come and pick him up on a stretcher and haul him to work. He showed up the next morning under his own steam. Everybody loved our company nurse, Laura Goodale. She kind of reminded me of the singer, Kate Smith. She was very amply built and had a great sense of humor and laugh. We used to kid any of our guys who went to her for minor cuts or bruises that they did so just to hear Laura's latest stories or jokes. I seem to remember that she had a little red light in her office window to help people find her station. Once, when I was instructing a boating safety course I asked Laura to give a talk on first aid. When she started out she sat on a table in front of the classroom. It collapsed. Laura got up, brushed herself off and used that as an example of how accidents could happen. Then she pointed out that most accidents that happen in the home occur in the bedroom. From that point on she kept the class in stitches with here stories. Laura made that evening both informative and entertaining. Sometime around 1949 or 1950 two more engineers were hired. They were Fred Bittner and George Thornburg. Both had master's degrees in engineering. I remember how they used to come back to the lab in the evenings to work on their projects. It kind of made the rest of us feel like we were shirking our responsibilities. Then a few months later Fred and George got raises. From then on they quit working late hours. The rest of us realized that after their raises they were no longer subject to overtime pay so lost their incentive to put in the overtime. Because of our staff increase and workload we began to outgrow the laboratory space. Sometime in 1950, as I recall, we moved the lab to an empty warehouse building near 16\" Avenue at the other end of the factory complex. This also provided better parking facilities and space for outdoor testing. Move to the New Laboratory We were allotted the front half of the last building in the complex, adjacent to 16*h Avenue. The rear half of the building had a loading dock and a big overhead door at the rear and was still to be used as a warehouse. Offices were built in the front end of the building. Just inside the front door were the reception area and two vendor offices flanked on one side by the lab director's office of Ted Smoot and on the other by the tree or four man drafting area. Behind the drafting area was a large room that housed all of the project engineer's desks and a large office for the Chief Engineer for Gas Equipment, Marvin Stark. Behind Ted Smoot's office were a row of four offices, one of which was for the Chief Engineer of Oil Fired Equipment, Graham Dodds. All of the project engineers' and chief engineers' offices opened onto the oil and gas equipment test areas farther back in the old warehouse. Our most appreciated addition was our very own model shop. Instead of begging for fabrication time and materials from other departments, we could do much of the sheet metal and sheet steel work in our own shop on our own schedules. The shop was equipped with up-to-date power shears, presses, brakes and nibblers. Some of the machines carried the Lennox name since our own machine tool division built them. The model shop expert became Oliver Jordt. By this time our staff was beginning to grow so we hired a receptionist, Marla Goshon. This was also the time when Lennox management decided to add air-conditioning equipment to our line. Melvin Brown was hired as Chief Engineer of Refrigeration. Also Chet Culp came aboard to create our air-handling department as Chief Engineer of Air Handling. We began the development of engineering specifications, which led to the Engineering Handbook under Tom Drury. At the time of our move, the Oil Department consisted of Graham Dodds, who was Chief Engineer; Project Engineers Fred Bittner, George Thornburg and me, and Technicians Lester (Doc) Wood and Clarence Jansen. It seemed less than a year when Fred Bittner accepted a job with Heil-Quaker in Milwaukee (good German that he was), George Thornburg accepted a position on the staff of Oregon State College in Corvallis, Oregon and Graham Dodds was spirited away by Carrier to help with their entry into the heating market. Almost by default I was promoted to Chief Engineer of the Oil Department and was fortunate to obtain Bud Sieverding and Hank Bierwirth as project engineers. One of the things I remember vividly at that time were our Dictaphones. Ted Smoot, Mel Brown and I were the only ones that used these machines. The others wrote their correspondence and reports out longhand for later transcription by the stenographic pool up front in the corporate offices. Our Dictaphones used wax cylinders that recorded our dictation. Then after each transcription they were shaved and readied for the next use. Each day a courier would pick up the recorded cylinders and return the shaved ones. He carried them in a carrier that held six or eight at a time. One day Ted Smoot sent up about six cylinders containing a long report or dissertation when the courier dropped his carrier and broke many of the cylinders. Ted was incensed to say the least. It wasn't long after that we got ne machines that used unbreakable disks. Many interesting projects came along in the 1952 - 56 years and beyond. I'll talk about them now on a project by project basis. The Tobacco Drier Oil fired salamanders were in general use to provide heat for drying tobacco in the southern tobacco barnes. The tobacco was hung up on rack in these drafty barns, protected from the rains, and dried using the crude salamanders. I guess Lennox management was convinced by one of our southern territory managers that we could penetrate this market with an improved oil fired tobacco drier. So we designed a portable drier which consisted of an open topped firebrick combustion chamber fired with a gun type oil burner. The objective of the drier was to more efficiently burn the oil with less smoke than the salamanders put out. I don't know how many were sold but this was another interesting product in the Lennox line. Later many of these units were used to provide warehouse heating where the objective was to prevent freezing of stored goods such as canned goods. In fact it always amazed me how we would develop a product for one use and then some Lennox salesman would come along and sell it for another application for which we hadn't dreamed. The Prairie Schooner Going one step farther we mounted a little heat exchanger, fan and oil burner on a flat oil tank with wheels and put a casing around it. It kind of looked like a miniature Conostoga wagon so got the name Prairie Schooner. This little heater could be wheeled into a shop for spot heat around a work area. It became popular for use in auto garages and on building sites during construction. The Prairie Schooner also had a little stack at the top so the flue gasses could be ducted outdoors if desired. Over the years we produced several models of the Prairie Schooner as we upgraded fan motors, burners and controls. Apparently the spec. sheets didn't quite keep up with the changes or parts were out of stock because years later I would be approached with questions about repair parts for a given model. Sometimes I could remember and other times I had to dig into old records to find the spec. for an interchangeable component. When people would start out with \"Graydon, do you remember?\" I could always guess what was coming next. The Crop Drier Projects When Chet Culp came aboard he brought with him not only expertise in air handling, but also in crop drying, having worked for a crop drier manufacturer. Chet also brought with him a technician, Marion Free, who I was fortunate to get assigned to my department. Marion had also worked for the same crop drier manufacturer as Chet. Chet's first assignment was to provide all of our departments the means to evaluate blower performances. Of critical interest to us were not only the design and performance of a blower alone but also its performance when applied to a system. Such a system consisted of a heat exchanger, cabinetry, ductwork and sometimes a refrigeration coil. We nibbled away at another bay in the warehouse, at the rear of the lab, so Chet could build our first wind tunnel. This first one consisted of a single venture throat where Chet would run a pitot tube traverse to obtain the air velocity, which he would convert to cubic feet of air volume per minute (CFM). Measurements of atmospheric pressure and relative humidity were also critical so Chet could correct the air volume to a set of standard conditions. Later wind tunnels used multiple calibrated orifices, which did away with the tedium and inaccuracies inherent with the pitot traverse. As kind of a spin-off project we began work on a crop drier. This brought Chet and me into close collaboration since he did the design of the axial flow (seven blade propeller) fan and chassis, and I worked on the heat exchanger, oil burner and burner controls. The result was the Lennox Cropmaster. Testing of the Cropmaster was more severe than anything else I had done before. We towed it across measured potholes at 15 or 20 miles per hour and really shook burners and controls loose in the process. Then back to the drawing board to beef up the points of failure or replace components. Then back for some more testing until we were satisfied that a farmer couldn't damage the Crop Drier as he towed it down the highway or across his farm field. Since the burner and electric blower motor required 115 or 230 Volt AC electricity we had to provide interlocks and other protections against electric shock in the field. We also provided a grounding rod to ground the chassis since the Cropmaster was mounted on rubber tires. One model was equipped with an Onan gasoline engine to spin the axial flow fan and was also equipped with a belt drive to spin a 115-volt generator that powered the oil burner. Farmers just love to tinker with machinery and these cropdriers were no exception. In fact they blew up several of them when controls were bypasses or farm voltage was erratic. To counter this, we set a crop drier outside the lab and intentionally ran it through a series of cold and hot and delayed ignition test to blow up the unit. In a delayed ignition test we sprayed and vaporized oil into the heat exchanger for a period of time and then ignited it with a spark from the oil burner electrodes. We'd study damage done to the heat exchanger and learned how to provide structural ties to hold it together so all of the blast was channeled upward out of the stack or flue outlet. Then we learned how to design the rain cap on top of the stack which, until then, blew clear across the parking lot. During theses tests we warned the nearby neighbors about the boom which the test would produce. Also we ran control wires to switches inside the lab so we could blow the unit up from a remote and safe location. After each explosion I'd go out to assess the damage and reset things for the next blast. One time I looked back and saw Chet standing there with his hands on the switch box and a big grin on his face. From then on I took the switch box out with me when making inspections. A nearby farmer named Clarence Carlson volunteered to field test the cropdriers on his farm. Clarence was extremely innovative so we had some interesting days doing testing on his farm. Marion spent a lot of his time working with Clarence. The demands on the first Cropmaster soon outgrew its ability to deliver sufficient heated air so Chet and I began the design of a much larger drier. As I recall we upped the required oil burner capacity to something over one million BTUs per hour. I came up with a three-headed burner that could be fired in three stages while Chet developed a steel bladed axial flow fan. We became afraid of a cast aluminum fan because of the fear of shrapnel if it should fail and fly apart in pieces. Chet ran the steel bladed fan to destruction and all that happened was that the blades would bend and fold up if something hit them. We used a high-speed camera to record the test and watched the fan blades start to wobble and vibrate back and forth before failure occurred. At the same time we were working on the big crop drier, Chet came up with the design of a batch bin that had a 600-busshel capacity. The batch bin circulated the corn with a horizontal auger at the bottom and a vertical series of buckets to carry the corn to the top and then another horizontal auger to distribute the corn into the bins while the crop drier forced warm air through the falling corn. I designed the four million BTU propane drier for the batch bin. The reason that farmers were so interested in crop drying was that they had better control of timing than when they field dried it. They also experienced less corn loss than in the field and could better time their sales into the market. The New Holland Crop Drier Our final chapter in crop drying came when New Holland, a farm machinery company in Pennsylvania, put out bids for a crop drier. Lennox decided to submit a prototype for New Holland's evaluation. Since our Cropmaster didn't meet all of their requirements we had to design and build a new model and time was very short. Chet and I went down to the Des Moines Armstrong plant with just a list of the specifications - not drawings. We spent three days sketching out what we wanted, he on the chassis and blower and I on the heat exchanger and burner assembly mounts. After three days of day and night work we towed the unit back to Marshalltown for one day of final control application and fire testing. In fact, time was so tight that in the evening we had to suspend testing long enough for an artist to paint the New Holland logotype on the outer casing. At the same time Buzz Bowers was trying to get some dimensions so he could make the engineering drawings. The next day we shipped the crop drier to New Holland for their evaluation - just under the time wire. About two week later we got word from New Holland that we had won the contract and that they would soon place an order. When we asked for return of the prototype they said \"No Way!\". So we had to finish up Buzz's drawings using Chet's and my Des Moines sketches. In the meantime we had built a large aluminum shed against the east laboratory wall for testing the crop driers. It seems that the other guys in the lab objected to our indoor testing noise and stinking up the place with the products of oil combustion. The shed had a large overhead door at each end so we could wheel the dryers in and out both ways and also have plenty of ventilation. One day I asked Marion Free to run some delayed ignition test on our large crop dryer. I suggested that he wheel the drier out into the parking lot for the tests. H claimed that with both overhead doors open there'd be no problem with running the test inside the shed. So against my better instincts I gave the OK. About 15 minutes later there was a loud whoomph. Marion had just blown some of the side panels out of the shed Another use for our crop dryers, besides drying grain, was for a source of temporary heat on construction sites. We lent several dryers for use at the Iowa Power and Light Company generating plant, which was under construction east of town. One day I had to send Clarence Jansen out to change an oil line connection on two of the dryers. Three hours later he came back fuming. It seems that the construction union wouldn't let him touch the oil lines on our dryers until they had called in a union pipe fitter to do the job under Clarence's direction. So a ten-minute job took three hours. Perimeter Distribution System As we moved ahead on the equipment front we were also looking at new and improved duct distribution systems for residential heating. Since we had a better handle on blower design and performance, this gave us the ability to be more innovative with the distribution system. John asked us to develop and test four inch pipe systems which would feed to in-the-floor registers around the perimeter of the residence. The warm air from these upward discharging perimeter registers would entrain cooler air from the floor and the mixture would blanket the outside cold wall on up across the ceiling and down the inside wall to the return air grill. The key was to feed these registers from the four inch round ducts. Two of the first systems were tested in John Greiner's and my house in the Lennox Addition. He tested the system from which the four-inch pipes were fed from a trunk duct. My system consisted of the four-inch pipes running radially from the furnace plenum. Since we had just installed new carpeting in our house my wife, Ruth, admonished me that after cutting holes in her carpeting and floor the system had better work. While the old high sidewall system was still in operation I made a series of floor to ceiling and room to room temperature measurements. With the old system the difference between the temperature just off the floor and just below the ceiling ranged from ten to twelve degrees F. After we installed the perimeter system these differentials dropped to one to three degrees. My wife became a happy believer and so did our crawlers and toddlers. We also worked on the design of the return air system and locations of return air registers. These return systems played and equally important role in system performance, as the supply systems. It was just more difficult to sell dealers and installers of this fact. During this time several of us also served on committees of the National Warm Air Heating Association. The association built several research residences at the University of Illinois to test structures, equipment and systems related to warm air heating, and later, air conditioning. The real challenge came with the advent of split level houses where warm and cold air could migrate from one level to the next. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) had laid down a mandate that if the industry couldn't come up with a standard for split level homes then they would. This spurred the association to build two split-level houses and our industry came up with the answers and standards. The strategic placement of return air grills, correct location and operation of the thermostat and Continuous Air Circulation (CAC) were probably the most important requirements for split level comfort heating and air conditioning. The Coming of Residential Air-Conditioning Up until now most air-conditioning was confined to large buildings and businesses and was still too expensive for most residential applications. As the technology developed, costs started to come down, residential air-conditioning became more feasible. Once this happened residential air-conditioning was beginning to grow by leaps and bounds. Some of the large air- conditioning companies, such as Carrier and Trane, began to realize that they needed to branch out into the heating field to market year around cooling and heating systems. To do so they purchased small existing furnace companies. Lennox was the only furnace company that developed its own line of air-conditioners. The Lennox strength was in its existing dealer organization and its knowledge of and experience in the design and installation of residential and commercial warm air heating systems. In fact one of Lennox slogans was \"Congratulations, you already own half of a year around air-conditioning system\" Lennox hired Mel Brown to head up the Cooling Research and Development Department in Marshalltown. A compressor design and manufacturing facility was created in Fort Worth, Texas and air-conditioners were manufactured in Dallas. A challenge for us was to design warm air furnaces and blowers that could be married up with a cooling evaporator coil within the confines of an alcove or closet and within the height of an eight foot ceiling. Since many of the systems required a higher volume of air for cooling than for heating we had to increase the blower capacity and size for cooling. Then we developed two speed blowers to handle cooling in summer and the lower volume for heating in winter. Development of the LANDMARK Year Around Systems Each year, prior to sales and dealer meetings, we were asked to develop something new to whet everyone's appetite and to stimulate sales. Sometime around 1954 to 55 we were asked to develop a series of gas and oil fired furnaces and air-conditioning units made up of separate modular sections. The two most outstanding features were to be the flexibility to custom assemble a package system and the attractiveness of the cabinetry and color scheme. A new line of equipment we were asked to design to meet these goals was a modular year around unit in three pieces. At the base was a blower to handle both heating and cooling in its own cabinet. Above the blower we designed a group of oil fired, gas fired and electric furnaces with their controls in their own but matching cabinets. Then on top of the furnace the air conditioning department designed evaporator coils with their controls to set in a third matching cabinet on top of the furnace. This modular arrangement allowed the installer to mix and match components to satisfy the customer's heating and cooling requirements. This system was named the Landmark series. To design the furnace was a real challenge from my standpoint. The blower size and height was determined by the required maximum blower capacity. The maximum evaporator coil size determined the height of the evaporator module. I was told to design a furnace to fit in the space that was left between the blower and evaporator coil cabinets. It took a lot of trial and error and testing to get the job done but we did it. A share of the thanks went to Don Vreeland whose, Bettendorf Oil Burner company designed and built a small burner we named the midget oil burner. I installed one of the first Landmark systems in my own house on 10th Street. As usual I installed, instrumented and tested new Lennox systems in my own home where I could observe performance under field conditions. Start of Our Canadian Operation Sometime in the early 1950's Lennox opened a factory in Toronto, Ontario. Although the factory was to manufacture furnaces for the Canadian market, many of the parts were produced only in the US so were shipped to Toronto. Also our US designs were used and adapted to Canadian requirements. Because of this I made numerous trips to Toronto to work with their engineers and to become acquainted with the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), Canada's governing testing laboratory and approval agency. At that time Ray Robbins, later to become President of Lennox, was the General Manager of the Toronto Division and Bob Potter was the engineer with whom I did most of the work. During my evenings and weekends in Toronto I enjoyed some delightful times being hosted by Ray and by Bob. I especially remember the Boulevard Club where Lennox maintained a membership. The club had a great restaurant, curling courts, bowling alleys (duck pins) and badminton courts. Badminton was a real national sport in Canada and Bob Potter was one of the top seeded badminton contenders. Oil Furnaces for England I think that sometime between 1954 and 1956 that Lennox opened an operation in Great Britain. At that time we were told to design and test an in-expensive oil fired up flow furnace for the English market. I recommended that we adapt one of our current up flow oil fired furnaces using our standard gun burner. Since the least expensive route was to design the furnace around the old vaporizing pot burner, we were told to go that route instead. So we pulled our old pot burner design out of the hat and adapted it to an up-to-date up flow furnace-blower combination. We were told that the furnace should be painted white since these would be installed in the kitchen of the homes. White is one of the most difficult colors to work with since any slight flaw in the cabinet, such as a poor spot weld, becomes highlighted. We built a prototype, which we shipped to Great Britain via our Toronto Division. A month or so later we got word back that our prototype was not acceptable. It seems that people in England would turn off their heaters at night to conserve fuel. They simply crawled into bed with plenty of comforters. Since the vaporizing pot burner required a continuous burning pilot it became unacceptable for that reason. The next least expensive route was to design a furnace using a rotary wall flame burner. We purchased one of these Timken burners from the Torrid Heat Company and applied it to the up- flow furnace and submitted it for evaluation. Because the rotary wall flame burner was a little tricky to operate and service and was not in common use, this unit was also rejected. So finally we submitted a version of our furnace using our gun burner adapted to 50 cycle (Hertz) electric operation and got the approval to go ahead. Since Canada was a commonwealth nation we would ship to Toronto those parts which could only be produced in the US and Lennox Canada would complete the furnace assembly using parts they produced. The trick was that if a certain percentage of a furnace was produced or assembled by a commonwealth nation some import duties could be avoided So that was the beginning of our interesting thrust into the European market. The OG Series Industrial Heaters The project of which I am most proud involved the design work I did on these furnaces and the patent number 3111939, which I obtained in my name and signed over to Lennox. It all began when Lennox purchased a small company, which made large unit heaters. These are industrial warm air heaters which were rated at about 500,000 BTU/hr input. Lennox also hired its president Bud Stern. These heaters had a place in the market but also had limited applications because of their design. After assessing the market, it was decided to design a new, more versatile line of furnaces from the ground up. This new series was to burn either natural gas or oil and serve as a unit heater, central furnace or duct furnace in any position - up flow, down flow or horizontal flow. This project again brought Chet Culp and me into close association. Chet did the design work on the blower sections and built a small wind tunnel so he could test the burner combustion air blower for me. We worked together designing the cabinet structure to carry the considerable load of the blowers and heat exchanger when horizontally suspended from a ceiling or in any other position. One of my objectives was to design the axis of all rotating parts and other components to be parallel to the axis of rotation of the furnace itself through all of its positions. This meant that the furnace could be built and stocked and then rotated to any position on the job site. In fact we ended up with a furnace that could be built to about 90 percent completion and placed in inventory. Then the last 10 percent of the work could be done when the final specs were received even though there were thousands of possible combinations. Some of the variations were: Sizes: 490,000 BTU/hr, 630,000 BTU/hr, 1,250,000 BTU/hr Fuels: Natural Gas, LP Gas and Fuel Oil; Each fuel: Single Stage, Two Stage or Modulation Dual Fuel: Any combination of two of the above fuels Other Fuels: Coke oven gas or JP4 or JP5 aviation fuel Applications: Unit Heater, Duct Furnace or Central Furnace Positions: Up Flow, Down Flow or Horizontal Flow Blower Drives: To meet any air delivery requirements Voltages: Single phase - 230 Volts Three phase -- 208, 220, 440 or 550 Volts Controls based on: Lead Sulfide, Cadmium Sulfide or Flame Rectification flame sensors. A key to the success of the OG (Oil Gas) series was working closely with marketing, manufacturing and Underwriter's Laboratories each major step of the way. By the time we came to UL testing, their engineers agreed to run the tests in our laboratory, to do random testing on some sizes and configurations, and to extend listing to the other sizes and configurations. OG4 and OG5 Installations Many of the OG units were installed in our own factories as horizontal, dual fuel, overhead unit heaters suspended from the ceiling. These heaters could be operated on the less expensive interruptible natural gas and then switched to standby oil operation when extremely cold weather required industrial customers to discontinue the use of natural gas. Probably the most severe application of our OG series furnaces was their use as backup furnaces in Antarctic structures in complexes at the South Pole. The primary furnaces supplied by another manufacturer didn't work out so the OG units ended up successfully carrying the entire heating load, according to Bob Downing of our Lennox Calgary Division. A misapplication occurred at the General Electric factory in Morrison, Illinois. About a half dozen OG5-630 units were installed as gas fired makeup air heaters. These are furnaces that bring in outside air to replace that exhausted by paint booths and other manufacturing processes. This outdoor air needs to be heated to room temperature before being introduced into the factory. During the winter months the cold air passing over the OG heat exchangers caused the flue gasses to condense, and the resulting acids ate out the stainless steel heat exchangers. The solution was to block off some heat exchanger passes to make the furnace less efficient, which kept the flue gas temperature above the temperature of condensation as they were discharged up the flue. Since the Morrison Factory was also sold and supplied oil burner controls to Lennox, I would be asked by their receptionist whether I was coming there that day as a customer or as a supplier. Sometimes it was both. DEW Line De-Icers When the Distant Early Warning Line of radar detectors was being planned, a need for communication antenna de-icers arose. Apparently word had gotten out about our OG5 series units. Bell Telephone Laboratories, who were responsible for the DEW Line design, approached Lennox to bid on deicers for their 30 and 60 foot parabolic communication antennas. As it turned out, the Bell Lab people weren't all that knowledgeable about furnaces so had us sit down with them to draw up the specifications for the de-icing units. Ed Riggs, of our Des Moines offices, coordinated the contracts and business end of our work with Bell Labs and I worked with them on the design end of the project. Most of our meetings with the Bell Telephone people were held at our Des Moines, Iowa factory since the de-icers were to be built there. Many of the specifications were written around our OG5-630 oil fired furnaces since there was little competition in that market. Some of the specs deviated from our standard OG5-630 because of the unique requirements of the antenna de-icing application. For example, all of the controls, wiring, motor bearings, etc. would have to withstand ambient temperatures down to 80 degrees F below zero. This required special silicone based lubricants for the GE motor bearing, special insulation on the Essex supplied wires, and electric heaters for some of the electronic control systems. Even the oil had to be especially formulated for use at those temperatures. Because the control shack was to be situated away from the antennas, Bell Lab specified that all safety resets be remotely controlled from the shack. Normally a trip-out of a system safety, requires that the serviceman diagnose the cause and correct it before the system is re-energized by pressing the reset button. Bell insisted that they needed to try to restart the equipment from the shack rather than send a man out in a blizzard or below zero temperature to check out the problem. Sometimes a false or nuisance trip-out would occur and they wanted to try to restart the de-icer before sending a man out in that bitter cold. Another requirement was that all parts could be quickly changed out using quick disconnect devices. Rather than diagnose the failed component on the site they wanted to make a quick change-out and then bring the part back to the shack for test and evaluation. In fact we designed a special test rig so that the operators could plug in a control module and simulate the actual operation back in the warmth of the control shack. As we constructed the prototype unit I sometimes discovered ways we could produce a part less expensively and better, or improve on a control circuit to do the job better at less cost. Invariably my request would be denied because it didn't conform to the specifications. What was galling was that we virtually wrote those specifications in the first place. Once in a while I could get them to change the spec. but at other times I just simply complained as a taxpayer who had to help foot the bill. About that time the Western Electric Company stepped into the picture since they had the construction contract for the DEW Line System which was code-named White Alice. The Western Electric engineers and inspectors would then take over and work with our Des Moines production people while the units were being build in the plant. I don't remember the exact number of de-icers that were involved in the contract but three of them were to be installed in each 60 foot parbolic antenna, and two in the 30 foot antennas. In addition there were two sets of spare parts to be supplied with each unit. Just as production was about to begin, Western Electric hit me with the request to obtain Underwriters Laboratory listing of the de-icers. I explained that we had already violated so many UL requirements to meet their needs that it would be impossible to obtain a blessing by UL. They continued to insist so I set up a meeting between the Western Electric engineers and UL engineers. After much travel expense and time, the UL engineers finally convinced Western Electric that UL listing was out of the question. Finally, after about a year of working on the White Alice project, I was able to get back to the job of running the oil R&D department full time. The only problem was that about two years later we got a call from Federal Electric, who had the installation contract, that the furnaces were malfunctioning and that we should send someone up to Alaska to check them out. I should point out that because of the secrecy surrounding this project we weren't given many of the details about the installation of the de-icers. I couldn't make the trip to the DEW Line so I sent technician Clarence Jansen and engineer Bud Sieverding. I don't think they ever forgave me since they flew commercial until they ran out of airlines and finally had to fly in with a bush pilot. When they got to the job site the problem became immediately apparent. The antennas were totally enclosed on their back side so the de-icing units were inside a hanger-like structure. Western Electric had installed the units with ducted stacks (chimneys) to remove the flue products but had not made provisions for bringing air into the structure for combustion. Consequently the poor de-icers huffed and puffed trying to get air for combustion but because of the lack of air they generated soot, which quickly plugged up the heat exchanger. In addition to that, condensation would occur inside the structure and rain down on the controls and electrical wiring. To cure the problem, air was ducted from the outside directly into the burner intake and a roof was constructed over the units to shed the condensate rainfall. In the meantime every unit had to be opened up and cleaned out. As far as I know, that took care of the problems because we didn't get anymore reports after that. Someday, while in Alaska, I hope that I can visit these sites if they are still up and in operation. Alaska Pipeline Barracks Heaters Another interesting project involved the Alaska pipeline construction. During the construction whole \"cities\" were airlifted into the remote areas where construction was under way. These ATCO cities included barracks, mess halls, administration buildings, etc. Lennox got the contract to supply the heating systems for these portable buildings. As I recall, Bob Downing of our Calgary office coordinated the project. Our lab provided the technical backup and service support. As was the case with the White Alice project, our concern was with the oil specifications and temperatures. Bob had samples of the oil to be used sent to us for analysis and test in our oil burners. We refrigerated the oil down to the minimum temperature, which ATCO said they would encounter and we approved the operation at that temperature. A year or so later we started getting reports back about barracks or mess halls burning down because of fires caused by our oil burners. After an investigation, Bob reported that in order to pipe the thick, cold oil from the storage tanks Alyeska had installed pumps to pressurize the oil and force it through the pipes at something like 100 psi. The problem was that our oil burner pump shaft seals were designed to take only 25 or 30 psi,, which is the maximum from gravity feeding. So they were blowing the pump seals and spewing oil all over the place, which eventually caused the fires. Changes in the Oil Department To digress for a minute, I'd like to discuss some events that took place in the oil department even before some of the above- described projects. As we expanded our department projects to include the commercial and industrial gas and oil fired equipment I found that we were having difficulty in moving engineers and technicians around between the residential projects and the larger more specialized projects. So I decided to split the department into two sections. Marion Free and Clarence Jensen would devote all of their time to the big projects such as Crop Dryers and OG series furnaces. I assigned George Koerber and Doc Wood to the residential projects and kind of floated the other engineers and technicians to projects on an as-needed basis. I found much of my time and efforts devoted to guiding equipment through Underwriter's Laboratories and serving on their committees as well as those of the National Warm Air Heating and Air Conditioning Association. I also became involved with the American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and became a member. At one time we were confronted with a real tight and critical time schedule for the testing and listing of an oil fired stowaway furnace. I couldn't spare any of my crew to take the unit into UL so I decided to take it in myself. Shipping it wouldn't get it there in time to meet the test schedule we had negotiated at the UL test laboratory in Northbrook, Illinois. The next morning I backed my station wagon up to the lab loading dock and had the guys load the furnace into the back and strap it down. Before departing for UL, I had some office work to finish. Then when I went out to the station wagon to start the trip I found the stowaway furnace decked with flowers which made me look like I was hauling someone's casket. I guess everyone had a good laugh out of my reaction and I simply hauled flowers and all to the UL unloading dock in Northbrook where their technicians were taken aback at the time of unloading and then they had a good laugh, too. On another occasion, I had been on a conference trip for three or four days. When I returned, one mid morning still in business attire and with briefcase in hand, I walked up to my office door, took hold of the doorknob but it wouldn't open. I kind of tugged and tugged until I noticed some of the crew down the hallway kind of chuckling and laughing at my consternation. Then as I studied the door I noticed that the doorknob and hinges were on the same side of the door. No wonder it wouldn't open. Because our doors opened into the lab in such a way as to clobber people as they walked by, John Greiner or someone had arranged to have the doors re-hinged in the other direction. The exception was my door for which the workmen were instructed to hang it so the doorknob was on the same side as the hinges. Whenever practical jokes were played, our people seemed to be extremely creative. Going back to the plan engineering days, our draftsmen then sat on high stools at their drafting boards. One of them came to work one day with a long tail attached to the back side of his belt. As he sat on the stool the tail hug almost to the floor-that is until some girl would walk by. At that time the drafisman continued with his drawing work but the tail would curl up and start wagging as the girl walked by. He had rigged a string or wire up his sleeve to operate the tail whenever he noticed a fair damsel out of the corner of his eye. Underwriter's Laboratory Visits I made many trips each year to the Underwriter's Laboratories gas and oil department. First it was located just off Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago and then moved to a country setting in Northbrook, Illinois. This allowed them to run tests they weren't allowed to run in the crowded downtown location. Most of my trips involved pre-submittal conferences, testing of our equipment or working on the UL standards Industry Advisory Conferences (IAC) committees. I discovered that prior to committing a furnace to a UL test date, testing time and money could be saved by going over the design and specifications with them ahead of time. Consequently, once we committed a furnace to UL test it rarely failed. When it did fail a test, the failure was minor in nature and easily and quickly corrected. Back in our own laboratory I had the project engineers and technicians try to create failures that might occur during UL testing. Then I had them either figure out how to recover from the failure or to design a fix-it kit to have on hand to prevent delays in the test schedule. Sometimes I disagreed with an interpretation a UL test engineer applied to their standards. We'd discuss the matter and sometimes I'd have to give in but sometimes the engineer agreed with me. On issues of critical importance I'd seek the engineer's permission to discuss the matter with the head of the department, Herb Witte. Usually this was OK with the engineer. If Herb and I went out to lunch and I came back with a favorable ruling from Herb, the engineer would ask me if it was a one martini or a two martini decision. Of course it was a no martini decision. Ha! Underwriter's Laboratories ran many interesting and dramatic test on materials and devices. If I happened to be at UL when one of these tests was to begin I'd often be invited to witness One of the more dramatic ones was the setting afire of a replica of the General Motors' Lavonia, Michigan hydromatic plant that burned down several years earlier. GM and the auto industry underwrote the building of a replica of the Lavonia plant and next to it a structure that was designed to prevent such a recurrence. Each structure was set afire on different days to verify the weakness of the Lavonia factory and then the resistance to burning of the corrected construction. Another test, which was underwritten by the tire industry, involved the method of warehousing tires, and the system designed to extinguish such a fire before it got under way. Thirty thousand tires were used during this series of tests. Sure created lots of smoke. An interesting one was the same type of test that was run on tires but involved the warehousing of whiskey and other alcoholic beverages stored in wooden barrels. Since UL's motto was \"Testing for Safety\" some of us kidded them about changing it to \"Tasting for Safety\". When the tests were completed I was offered some of the empty whiskey barrels to take home with me. Since Iowa was a dry state, I figured it would be my luck to get stopped at the Iowa border and they'd find a little booze still in the barrel. So I thanked the UL fellows and declined. UL also tested reinforced concrete floors used in building construction. In cases of multi-story buildings fires it was aiways the fear of firefighters that floors would collapse one on the other. no standards for construction were developed. UL did its testing by constructing a reinforced concrete floor over a firebrick lined one-story pit. The floor was then loaded with barreis of water to which were attached surveyor's rods. The floor deflections were recorded. Then a series of salamanders were ignited in the room below the floor and temperatures brought up to 1,600 degrees F for several hours while deflections in the floor were monitored. Finally the salamanders would be turned off and ire retardant suit and hood would break down a pyrobar door into the pit. Finally another would spray the underside of the floor with a fire hose. The floor would have to hold up under this torture and not collapse or exceed an allowed deflection. Other tests involved roof shingles, prefabricated fireplaces, fire-protected filing cabinets and safes, and hundreds of other materials, appliances and devices. UL had a staff of inspectors in the field who periodically paid unannounced visits to the factories or businesses of manufacturers who made UL listed and labeled products. Our Marshalltown inspector was Al Schmoranz. He was welcomed into our plant at any time. Interesting Lab Projects and Tests Our many projects and products always presented new problems and the challenges to solve theses problems. Sometimes we'd turn to innovative methods and sophisticated instrumentation to find our answers. While working on the design of oil burner firing heads, I wanted to know what happened at the instant of burner flame ignition and to learn how the flame developed after ignition. One day Kenny Kracht, our chief photographer, mentioned that Eastman had come out with a high-speed camera that could take hundreds of frames per second. I immediately jumped on this as an opportunity to observe oil burner ignition. Kenny contacted Eastman and they sent a camera and cameraman to our lab to photograph our burner. The results were astounding. I could see, in slow motion, the ignition electrode spark slowly jumping from one tip to the other even though it was actually going back and forth 60 times per second. Then the arc gradually fanned out into the developing oil spray and slowly ignited the base of the spray and then the flame spread outward until complete combustion was taking place. We couldn't afford to purchase the camera but this experience certainly provided a better insight into what was happening with an oil burner and pointed the direction for improved burner head desigas During a visit to the Minneapolis Honeywell Company in Minneapolis T observed a new instrument they had developed. It was called a Visicorder. The Visicorder could record, on Photo sensitive tape, events that were ocouming hundreds of time cach second. It could record voltage, pressure, sound, light and about anyiung cise for winch a sensor or transducer was availabie. i watched in amazement as the tape spewed out and had stretched a 60 cycie per second sine wave trace to a lengin of five or six inches. After several years of submitting my budget to purchase a Visicorder I finally got the OK. I assigned its operation to Bob Malachek, who was my lead technician. Bob got so he could make it do wonders. Pulsation and resonance was always a problem with both gas and oil fired furnaces. The causes weren't well understood so solutions had to be obtained by trial and error. With the Visicorder and using a pressure sensitive transducer we were able to measure pressure fluctuations from a burner blower and anywhere in a burner and even inside a heat exchanger. The frequencies were stretched out on the recording tape. In fact we could record up to 12 pressure, voltage, rpm, etc. simultaneously. This provided the means to study the interactions between the combustion blower pressure fluctuations, flame frequencies and the natural frequency of the internal heat exchanger. Once we were confronted with a mystery of who our oil burners designed for the 50 cycle (Hertz) international market weren't able to deliver their deigned output. We brought one into the lab and hooked the burner motor up to the Visicorder. The test immediately identified the problem. Somehow the American 60 cycle motors were being shipped on these burners which caused them to rotate more slowly. The motors didn't reach sufficient speed to open the centrifugal switch to the starting windings. The Visicorder was also used to advantage in several lawsuits, which were brought against our dealers to whom we provided technical assistance and were expert witnesses. Sometimes metal fatigue and fracturing would occur because of the constant heating and cooling of oil and gas fired heat exchangers. Also thermal stresses would occur because of the differences in temperatures on the surface of the heat exchanger. Some locations on the surface would be too hot and others too cool. We attached thermocouples to the surfaces to measure these temperatures but, at best, this was a hit and miss method. One day I learned about infrared camera film. So I got a roll, put it in mu camera and started to experiment with taking infrared pictures of the heat exchangers to \"see\" the temperature patterns. My crude setup provided some information but was cumbersome and didn't work out all that well. Next I learned about an infrared camera that was used in aerial photograpy to spot hot electrical insulators on power lines, heat loss through residential roofs and in taking thermal mammograms to detect breast cancer. The camera manufacturer ran some demonstrations in our lab but again the camera was too expensive to fit into my budget so ended there. Furnace Controls One of the major manufacturing costs of a furnace involved the purchasing of controls. Every furnace required a high temperature limit control, a fan (blower) control and a primary safety control for oil burners and a pressure regulator, pilot control and electric main burner valve for gas furnaces. This was a highly lucrative and competitive market for the numerous control manufacturers. Manufacturers included Minneapolis Honeywell Regulator Company, White Rodgers, General Electric, Penn Controls, among others. The Lennox reputation for quality and volume purchasing made it one of the control manufacturers most sought after customers. I made it a point to visit every one of the control manufacturer's plants to see and evaluate their operations. I was able to pick the brains of their engineers and learn about the design and manufacturing of the controls. They also picked my brain to our mutual advantages. These trips also provided the opportunity to visit with their engineers and teach them about the requirements of Lennox and our industry. As our heating equipment became more compact and complex we were able to communicate with the control people to design and manufacture controls to meet our specific needs. Back in the days of the big furnaces, which were assembled on the job, Honeywell had the lion's share of the market. They made a single fan and limit control which the installer stuck into the plenum and field wired to the burner and blower. They stuck another safety (primary) control into the flue pipe which they wired to the oil burner and which controlled the burner. And finally they marketed most of the thermostats so they could provide a full complement of controls. Their controls were of high quality and well accepted by dealers and installers in the field. They were also expensive. It became the policy of Lennox to develop multiple and interchangeable sources for out controls and other purchase parts to both encourage competition and to protect us against interruptions of deliveries because of strikes or control defects. As our furnaces became more compact and factory assembled, we moved the fan and limit controls and oil burner primary controls down into the furnace cabinet vestibule. This required greater sophistication in the application of the controls and the design of more compact controls than Honeywell had previously manufactured. About this time two new upstarts entered the fan and limit control field. They were Camstat and Thermodisc. We worked closely with these two companies who were anxious to tailor their controls to our needs. The results were more compact and much less expensive controls. And they worked jus fine. I remember Carl Shick, of Honeywell, commenting that \"Hell would have to freeze over before Honeywell stooped to making such 'cheap' controls\". About a year later Carl set up a dinner meeting at Lloyds Restaurant for a group of us from Lennox. After dinner he opened the meeting by remarking \"Well, gentlemen, Hell just froze over\" With that, he introduced the new compact and much less costly Honeywell fan control and limit control. As the air conditioning market took off and became increasingly lucrative, Lennox management's attention became more focused on this technology. Before long some of us realized that the heating equipment development was beginning to take a back seat In the early days of our cooling involvement, I mentioned my desire to learn and get involved in the air conditioning field. I was told that one could learn cooling technology in a mater of a year but that heating was both an art and a science and it took years of experience to become and expert heating engineer and manager. This is true. In the case of heating technology we need to deal with the combustion of many fuels including coal, a number of grades of fuel oil, natural gas, manufactured gas, LP gas, coke oven gas, JP4 aviation fuel and finally electricity. We must design the means to deliver combustion air in the precise amount and pattern to mix with the fuel efficiently We must design heat exchangers to transfer the heat from the combustion of fuel to circulating air or water. Then we must design sophisticated control systems to prevent fire, explosion or carbon monoxide hazard. Finally we must design and apply controls that will operate the burner and start and stop air or water circulation at the correct temperature and time. As our residential and commercial heating and air- conditioning product lines exploded so did the need for more laboratory space and test facilities. Lennox management decided to bring in an air conditioning manager from Fort Worth to head up the R&D laboratory. We soon discovered that his knowledge of combustion, fuels and heating equipment was extremely limited if not non-existent. We discovered later that he did not have an engineering degree. Non-the-less he became an instant \"heating expert\" and started imposing decisions on us that we knew would hurt our equipment. I resisted and tried to explain why some of his edicts would adversely affect our designs. He wouldn't listen so I had no choice but to follow his orders. When the results of his decisions didn't pan out he would lay the responsibility on my shoulders. At that time I started to distance myself from responsibility for those changes. (Several years later, after lab management had been changed, I was asked to be loaned to the lab to solve some of the problems and rescue some of the equipment which was failing as the result of those poor management decisions and orders.). When the time for year-end review arrived I was the only one in the department that was not even given the courtesy of a review, much less a raise. Then an opportunity arose which allowed me to get away from the R&D lab and its poor management. THE BEGINNING OF A NEW CHALLENGE The Harvard Invitation Our Lennox president, John Norris, told me that Lennox was invited to put on a series of seminars at the prestigious Harvard Graduate School of Architecture. The purpose was to teach the fundamentals of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) to the students so they could design more energy efficient structures and better communicate with HVAC designers, engineers and installing contractors. Others who were invited represented companies from the steel industry, cement industry and building contractors. I was asked to design a group of training aids to demonstrate the principles of subjects such as conduction, radiation, convection, humidity, forced air flow, etc. I spent several interesting months at my drawing board and out in our shop creating these trainers. When the time of our trip arrived, I rented a U-Haul trailer, loaded it with the trainers and trailed them behind my car to Cambridge. I don't remember all of those who were there at Harvard to make the presentations but know they include John Norris, Jr. and Ted Gilles. We were met with some skepticism on the part of the students since they thought we were there solely to promote our own selfish interests and would inhibit their creativity. By the time our seminars were completed they realized that the knowledge they gained would be crucial to the design of practical and functional structures for their future clients. In fact at the end of the seminars we were invited to their design classrooms to consult with them and critique their designs. One of the challenges, while we were in the Boston area, was to find our way between our hotel, the Harvard campus and other locations along their crazy quilt of streets. It seems that they were laid out along old cow-paths of colonial years. There were no square blocks, plenty of ups and downs and continuous lane changes from one exit to another. One morning I was driving to our Harvard appointments with three other Lennox guys when I made a wrong turn and got into a narrow, hilly residential street area. After pulling into a driveway and backing into the street to turn around I backed into a garbage can which had been set on the curb across the street. It rolled on its side and down the hill taking other neighbor's garbage cans along with it, all of which were spewing garbage along the way. We four guys, in our business suits, considered our options. 1. Stop and pick up the garbage cans and garbage. 2. Get the hell out of there. After a moment of discussion we opted for option 2. Often Ted Gilles and I would be on our way to Harvard and be in the wrong lane at an off ramp. The result was a tour of Boston while trying to find our way back. We did this not once but being slow learners did it two or three times. While conduction our seminars we met an engineering faculty member named Neal Mitchell. Neal had developed a group of tabletop trainers to teach the principles of structures. He wanted to have these manufactured and made available to other schools but didn't have the manufacturing facility or marketing organizations to do the job. He asked Lennox to do this for him. Our management agreed. As the result, John Norris approached me one day and asked if I would be interested in heading up the engineering for a new Lennox Education Division. This was not only the opportunity to leave the R&D lab but also to start in a new endeavor with a clean slated. I didn't hesitate for a moment to accept. This was the beginning of a few years of creative heaven. Birth of the Education Division Te mission of the new Education Division was two-fold. The first was to reduce Neal Mitchel's structures models and trainers to a manufacturable and marketable design and to market them. The second was to develop trainers and courses to teach heating and air-conditioning installation and service to our own dealer organization and for sale to colleges, vo-tech schools and prisons to train engineers and technicians for the HVAC industries. Initially I stayed in my old office pending the construction of a set of second floor offices for the new Education Division and the Lennox Marketing Department. During that time I designed and built some electrical circuit training boards on my office desk. About a month later I moved to our second floor offices with our new director of the Education Division, Al Russell and a secretary, Kay, whose last name I can't recall at the moment. These were temporary quarters that we shared with the Marketing group until we could move to a large first floor area in an adjacent warehouse building. Most of our time was devoted to planning the layout in our new quarters and production shop under construction and hiring additional workers. At that time we hired Bob Zimbleman to head up our technical writing section to develop training manuals to go with our trainers and Joe Haunsperger, a master tool and die maker, who would be under my direction and who would head up our production shop. About a month later we moved to our new quarters. They consisted of an area of five offices in the front of the building and a large shop area behind the offices. The offices were rather bare with just a desk, several chairs and a file cabinet. I volunteered to design cabinets, shelves and additional counter space at the back of each office and was told to have at it. The counter I designed had a center section that was hinged and could be tilted up to any angle to form a drawing board, if desired. I tailored each system to fit the specific dimensions of each of the offices. They went from wall to wall at the rear of each office. We ordered them built by a local cabinet shop. In about six weeks they were completed and installed. Boy, were they beautiful and our offices became the envy of other departments. I had even more fun working with Joe Haunsperger laying out and getting our shop up and going. Joe was a great scrounger and a master at moonlight requisitioning. He knew every nook and cranny in the factory and where stuff was stored that had long been forgotten and which departments had stuff we might need. For example, we needed reels and reels of various colored electrical wire for our trainers. Joe knew of one department that had a room- full of excess reels of electrical wire they no longer could use. He offered to clear it out for them at no charge. About eight months later they needed some of it back so Joe sold them some of it we didn't need. He worked in the evening scrounging around the factory for workbenches, tools, cabinets, etceteras that didn't appear to be in use by anyone. Then the next evening he and several other of our guys would pick them up and move them to our shop. That's what is called moonlight requisitioning. This freed up our budget to purchase raw materials we needed to build our trainers. The list of materials we needed for the structural trainers was an interesting one. It included a collection of high grade lumber, flat brass wire strips, Plexiglas sheets, dental wax, pea beans, clear molding resin, brass weights, sheets of rubber, just to name some I can remember. We purchased the dental wax from a dental supply house. For months later I was inundated with sales literature from the dental supply house thinking we had a humongus dental practice. My job was to design the trainers using these materials based on the concepts the Neal Mitchell had developed. Joes's job was to build these trainers in his shop and package them for shipment to customers. Bob's job was to develop the instructions and Al Russell's job was to do the marketing to potential customers. Below and on the adjoining photo pates illustrate some of the material and trainers we made and marketed. This was the most creative and productive fun I can remember. One day Artie Wansley, one of our company photographers, posed me with some of the trainers for an article in our Lennox News. The Design and Construction of my New Office Because my old office was in an inconvenient location from the shop area, I decided that I needed to create a new office adjacent to the shop. I got approval to not only design the construction of my new office but was given carte blan to design its interior and to select the furniture to go into it. I laid it out as a kind of a combination office and mini shop where I could not only design the trainers but test the prototypes and work with Bob Zimbleman to write the instruction manual to go with the trainer. I could also work more closely with Joe Haunsperger to coordinate each design with his shop operation. The three of us became a really smooth operating team. In fact we collectively made most of the decisions without having to consult with boss Al Russell. To explain the above, Al was a night person who really didn't get up to speed in the morning until ten or eleven o'clock. By that time we had to make decisions and get our operation up to full steam. We had discovered that it was better to leave Al alone until after lunch. Beside that Al's main job was to market the products we produced to companies outside of Lennox. School Administrator's Convention Each year Lennox participated in several national trade show to promote and sell heating and air conditioning equipment and systems. One of them was the American Association of School Administrators. This was such a huge show that only Atlantic City could accommodate the 30,000 or so attendees and three huge halls of exhibits. Exhibits covered absolutely everything involved with schools and education including bricks, mortar, air conditioning equipment, lighting, desks, bathroom stuff, books, school busses fences, link trainers, planetarium, even toilet tissue, you name it, it was there. This was the show were the people who made the purchasing decisions were in attendance. I think it was about in 1971 or 72 that we went to Atlantic City with booths promoting our HVAC systems and also a booth devoted to our Education Division structures trainers. A lot of money and professional work went into the designing of the HVAC booths and outside sales girls were hired to help with the promotion. We, in the Education Division designed and built our own booth and I did the explaining and promoting of the trainers at our booth while Al worked the backroom meetings and meetings at the bar. Several of the gals hired to work the Lennox HVAC booth became intrigued with our structures models and offered to pinch hit for me, when they were off duty, so I could tour the exhibit halls. It was a fantastic experience. When I unpacked my suitcase in my hotel room I discovered a pile of envelopes, each one dated with a day I'd be at the convention. Each envelope contained a little love note from Lorraine. Each morning I'd open one for that day which got the day started with a wonderful glow. When I told the other guys about it I think they were envious of my good fortune to have a wife like Lorraine. When the convention was completed, we had a day to disassemble and pack up our booths and displays and ship them back home. Dave Chase supervised this job for the HVAC exhibit and I did it for the structures exhibit. After our job was done we had an extra day in Atlantic City so Dave and I explored the boardwalk and went to Madam Thesaud's Wax Museum among other attractions. When I returned home Lorraine asked me how I happened to tear out both pockets in my London Fog topcoat. I told her how I'd started down a flight of outdoor steps at the hotel with both hands in my coat pockets. As I reached the bottom step I tripped. As I went down, I was in such a hurry to get my hands out of my pocket to break my fall that I ripped the pockets out in the process. DEVELOPMENT OF LENNOX HVAC TRAINERS After we got our feet firmly planted on the ground and production up and running with the structures trainers I turned my attention to the design of trainers for teaching Heating, Ventilating and Air-conditioning (HVAC). These trainers were designed for use in teaching our own Lennox dealer personnel how to install and service Lennox equipment. In fact we created and staffed classrooms in each of our divisions to train our dealers, sales and service people. Later these training programs were marketed to outside organizations such as colleges, vocational-technical schools and even prisons. This marketing effort kept Al Russell busy and out of Bob's, Joe's and my hair allowing us to let our collective creative juices flow unhindered and our shop to operate under a full head of steam. Table Top Trainers Some of the earliest training aids I designed were called tabletop trainers. They could simulate, in the classroom, the real life equipment, its operation and problems a serviceman might encounter in the field. I would first meet with our engineers and service people to learn of their training needs and field service problems with a variety of equipment. Then I'd sit down at my drafting table to lay out the design and circuitry for a tabletop trainer. Then I'd get with Joe Haunsperger and his crew to critique the construction and build a prototype model of the trainer in our shop. After that I'd take it back to my office where I'd test the operation, refine the design and make a final set of shop drawings and release it for production. Bob Zimbleman and I would then sit down together to write an operating and service manual for the trainer and a sales bulletin. Electric Schematic Diagram Trainers The first series of trainers that I designed were configured to teach students how to read and interpret schematic electrical diagrams. Schematic diagrams illustrate, in the simplest way, the electrical connection between the various components, relays, switches and other devices in the heating or cooling equipment. See the picture below. When I turn down the thermostat the circuits that it controls will light up in sequence and start the air-conditioning unit which will also light up. This helps the student understand the interconnections and the purpose of each relay and switch in the control system. Another type of schematic circuit trainer was designed to teach gas and liquid flow circuits as illustrated by the Heat Pump Cycle Trainer illustrated below. As each of the circuits are back- lighted, a flowing pattern occurs. Gradual changes in color indicate the temperatures of the fluids in the circuit and the changes from liquid to gas and gas to liquid. Designing these trainers was some of the most enjoyable and fun times I can remember in my days with Lennox. Following is a description of some of the trainers and pictures of them. Two Ton Compressor Trainer There was a need to train service technicians about the operations and trouble shooting of air-conditioning electrical circuits. To bring this into the classroom I worked with our air- conditioning engineers to layout the circuitry and learn of the problems that could be encountered in the field. I then went back to my office to lay out a schematic diagram of the circuits and the refrigeration components involved. In the design of this trainer, I used parts which appear on the actual product whenever possible. I used parts such as the fuse box, capacitors and the like. Since it was impractical to use a real compressor, I took a picture of one which I mounted on a piece of Masonite. This then was mounted to the trainer board with rubber grommets. On the rear of the compressor picture I attached a little vibrator to the compressor which made the compressor shake slightly when it was running just like the real thing. In fact it also sounded like a real compressor. I then wired in switches and relays on the rear of the trainer to create any one of 17 faults in the operation. The instructor could flip any one of the fault switches to create a fault. Then the student, using his diagnostic instruments would be required to test the circuits and identify and correct the fault. The advantages were that any number of these trainers could be safely used in the classroom under the direction of a single instructor. Each trainer included an instructor's manual. Electric Heat Service Trainer The Electric Circuit Heat Trainer is one where the student is required to wire up all of the components of a unit. The instructor may disconnect all wiring on the trainer and then have the student wire it up while referring to a schematic diagram. This tests the student's knowledge of schematic diagrams while also imparting to him and understanding of the principles of an electric heating circuit. All circuits are protected by internal circuit breakers so that a wiring fault by the student will result in the same response as a live unit without blowing a classroom circuit. The 24-volt circuits are protected so that even if line voltage is wired to them in error, the components will not be damaged. The instructor can quickly pinpoint the student's error without having to trace through all of his wiring by observing which circuit is blown. Once the trainer is correctly wired the instructor can flip any of 45 fault switches on the rear of the trainer and then ask the student to trouble shoot and diagnose that specific fault. The instructor is provided with a manual and key to each of the faults. Thermostat Trainer Because I had worked closely with the companies that manufactured and sold thermostats to Lennox, I decided to design a trainer that would teach students how thermostats worked. The outcome of this was not only the trainer illustrated below but also a comprehensive manual to go with it. The most up-to-date thermostats of that day included a helical bimetal with a mercury switch mounted on it. As the temperature in the room changed the bimetal coil would wind or unwind and tilt the mercury switch in one direction or the other causing the mercury to make or break contact across two points, thus starting or stopping the furnace or air-conditioner. I designed a prototype trainer by tearing a Honeywell round thermostat apart and removing the bimetal coil and mercury bulb. Then I constructed the model shown in the picture by using the Honeywell parts but in a way that the student could see what was going on inside a thermostat and could play around with the adjustments to see the result of changing temperatures. When we were ready to go into production we needed several hundred helical bimetals and mercury switches. I went to Honeywell to purchase them. It took a little persuasion since Honeywell had to interrupt production of the thermostats to provide me with these parts. The most fun was working with Bob Zimbleman to write and illustrate the thermostat manual, which covered the design and operation of the earliest thermostats to the latest ones described by the trainer. Overhead Projector Water Table One day a gentleman came to me with an idea to make a water table which could be used on top of an overhead projector to project live water flow onto a large screen. However he didn't know how to create such a device. His thought was to somehow cause a thin film of water to flow in a transparent pan and to project light through this film of water onto the projector screen. The water could be colored by a dye. I agreed to pick up his idea from there and to design a water table. It took me about a year to bring this to reality since I had a lot of other projects going at the same time. The picture below illustrates the two components in the system when I finally completed it. The water table sets on top of the overhead projector. Six nozzles can force a 1/4 inch flow of water across the glass-bottomed table. On the floor is a container which holds the water, which is pumped to the table by an internal centrifugal pump. The container also includes a filter which filters the water, which is returned from the table back to the container. This diagram shows how the water table parts are connected and placed on the overhead projector. To control the flow of water I designed a group of table inserts that could be placed on the water table to control the flow of water. The water could be highlighted by sprinkling powdered graphite on it or with adding various colored dyes. The evolution of the water table occurred in a number of steps. After I had outlined the concept, I measured a number of different makes of overhead projectors to develop a set of dimensions for the water table which would fit most of them. Then I drew up a set of prints to build a water table using Plexiglas parts and brass nozzles. The water was fed to these nozzles from a water container and centrifugal pump. I used powdered graphite and colored dyes to highlight the water as it flowed across the table and the image of the water flow, which could represent either water or air flow, was projected onto the screen. Various shapes could be placed on the water table to illustrate how a fluid would flow around them. One such shape was a cross section of an airplane wing airfoil. Since it would be too; expensive and labor intensive to build the water table out of Plexiglas, my next step was to find a material and process to produce it efficiently. I decided that the use of Aluminum extrusions for the water table frame would be the answer. I contacted a company that extruded aluminum shapes and designed three aluminum cross-sections for the sides of the table. Each section had to be mitered and welded to the adjoining section so the water manifold, that circled the outside of the water table, would be water tight. Welding aluminum is as much an art as a science and requires a high level of expertise. Our Lennox Columbus factory was fabricating aluminum fuel cells for army tanks at that time so I flew to Columbus with a number of aluminum frame parts to show their welders how I wanted the parts welded into a frame. We designed jigs to hold the parts in alignment during the welding. In the meantime I worked with a company to make the tempered glass bottom for the table and a gasket manufacturer to fabricate a gasket to seal the glass into the aluminum frame. After all of the parts came together, I designed a series of inserts to illustrate various types of fluid flow. Some of these are illustrated below. I was asked to demonstrate the water table at a meeting of our Lennox Management Club. The following picture was taken during that demonstration. Here I'm ready to spray some powdered graphite onto the surface of the water, which will then project the laminar flow over an airplane wing airfoil section. I can change the angled of attack of the airfoil and the angle of the aileron. The water table, which was named the Lennox Flo-vu, was a commercial success and many were sold to schools and businesses. In fact some businesses used it as a research tool as well as a teaching tool. Our Line of Scale Models Our next challenge was to design and manufacture Plexiglas models of some our large, complex commercial heating and air- conditioning units. These were tabletop models, which could be assembled and disassembled during a presentation or instruction. I took the blueprints of the full size units and drew a new set to about 1/10 scale. To the left are a couple of pictures of those models using colored Plexiglas and pieces cast out of resin. The two lower pictures are two views of the same unit. The top one is partly assembled and the bottom one fully assembled. These are multizone units (around 17 zones), each zone which can be heated, cooled or ventilated independently. Each of these units is large enough to fill a flat bed truck trailer. They were lifted on to rooftops by helicopters. Model Houses Another project, which was lots of fun to do, was the design and building of Plexiglas model houses. The first ones were designed to teach some of the principles of HVAC. The little house below was designed to teach about air infiltration into a house. The candle in the fireplace is lit to create a draft up the chimney. Then a second floor window on the left could be opened. Titanium Tetrachloride smoke was introduced at the window. The student could watch as the smoke migrated from the second floor window to the stairway and down the stairway to the fireplace and up the chimney. Our international group was faced with the challenge to teach the virtues of warm air heating and air-conditioning to people in European countries such as Great Britain, France and Germany. These countries had traditionally heated with hot water systems using radiators. I was given the blueprints for a two story European house with the diagram for a hot water system and the plans for a warm air ducted system. From these I designed two scale model clear Plexiglas houses of the same design. These houses were true to scale in every respect both inside and out but were completely transparent. In one of them I laid out a complete hot water system with a boiler, plumbing and radiators in colored plastic. In the other I laid out a complete warm air system with a furnace, duct work and registers in colored plastic. We mounted these houses on a baseboard with some landscaping and designed a shipping crate for each. The models were sent overseas and toured to shows and were shown to architects throughout Europe. A Call for HELP from the R&D Laboratory About this time I got a call from Ray McCready, director of R&D, for help in solving a serious heat exchanger problem with the big multizone industrial rooftop units. I had been aware of the development of this heat exchanger under the previous director of R&D and felt that it had some serious design deficiencies. However I couldn't say anything since this was not my responsibility and the director was the one who had cut me off previously. Apparently Ray had discussed this with Al Russell and got his approval so the decision was up to me. Somewhat reluctantly, I said that I'd return toe R&D on a temporary basis until the problem was solved while my job in the Education Division was held open for my return. In fact I could work back and forth between the two as time permitted. I was to report directly to Ray. A new head of the heating department had been hired since my previous departure from R&D. I'll give him the fictitious name of Glen for a reason that will become clear later. Glen also reported to Ray. Apparently Glen had tried to solve this heat exchanger problem without success. At that time I didn't know that Glen did not have an engineering degree and really didn't understand the technology that well. He had been hired as a manager and that seemed to be that. To make a long story short, I ran some calculations and discovered the root of the problem in the first two days. The primary heat exchanger volume was simply too small to allow combustion to be completed before the products of combustion entered the secondary tubes. I designed and tested a fix-it kit that extended the primary drum some eight or ten inches. After several months of testing, I was satisfied that this fix was the best possible but that the heat exchanger still wasn't all that good. In my final report I recommended that the fix-it kit be applied to existing heat exchangers in the field but that the heat exchangers be dropped from the line and production terminated. Management seemed so happy to get this problem behind them that they ignored my recommendation and continued to manufacture the heat exchanger with the extended primary drum. Invitation to Return to the R&D Laboratory Full Time Shortly after my return to the Education Division I was asked if I would be willing to return to the R&D Laboratory on a full time basis. Ray McCready had discussed this with Al Russell who agreed to leave the decision up to me. I agonized about this since I did enjoy the freedom to innovate and the creative challenges of the Education Division. On the other hand, I realized that the products designed and tested in the Laboratory were infinitely more important to Lennox than the Education Division trainers. Also I felt that since the Lab management had changed since I had left, I could now work productively there. After a few days of indecision, I agreed to return to the R&D Lab. Al Russell gave his OK under the condition that I would find my replacement in the Education Division. After considering several possibilities, I settled on Bob Hamos who was a factory engineer with whom I had worked in the past. I approached Bob who was reluctant at first. After much selling and persuasion from me he agreed to take on the job. Ray welcomed me back to work on our heating products. I would report to Glen. That, as it turned out, was my mistake. I should have insisted that I report to Ray as my condition for returning. After my return I began to realize that Glen perceived me as a threat to him and at one time confided in me that he was afraid that he might be fired. I told him to forget it and that I had no desire to get kicked upstairs to his ivory tower job away from the close proximity to the nuts and bolts work on the Lab floor. Besides I knew that I would have considerable freedom for making decisions on my own with Ray's blessings. It did present a little awkward problem for Glen but I figured that was his problem and tried to stay out of his hair. After my return I found that I was welcomed, with relief, by my old Lab crew and had a couple of new technicians to work with. One was Floyd Cherington. Some of my early work had to do with equipment problem solving and as an expert witness in lawsuits. There had been problems with the failure of some heat exchangers in one of our furnaces due to thermal stresses created in the metal heat exchanger from repeated heating and cooling of the metal and excess temperature gradients during each cycle. The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) was concerned about cracks in the heat exchanger which might allow carbon monoxide to enter the warm air stream and enter the residence. The problem was to determine the cause of these stresses and correct it. I thought back on my earlier work with an infrared camera where we could photograph temperature gradients in a heat exchanger. I put in a request to rent an infrared cameral that could record these temperatures and was given the OK. I designed and had built a test setup to calibrate the camera. See the photo above. Using the camera, we were able to determine the heating and cooling patterns on the heat exchanger and alter the burner placement and air flow to reduce the stresses. Then I hired a professional photographer to make a movie of our tests and the changes we made to correct the problem. Glen and I then flew in the company plane to Toronto where we presented our findings to CSA and got their approval to continue sales pending their verification by their lab tests. SOLAR ENERGY It was around 1976 that the Sun's Energy was beginning to gain recognition in this country as a viable source of energy that could be harnessed to heat domestic water as well as for other uses. I had been closely following the budding solar energy technology and felt that it might have a place in Lennox's future. So I worked evenings drafting a ten or twelve page detailed proposal explaining solar energy, potential products and why Lennox could benefit and how to proceed with such a program. I submitted this proposal to Lennox management. Lennox accepted the proposal and began to develop and add solar powered water heaters to its line of products using a residential roof top solar panel to heat the water and store it in a conventional electric powered hot water tank to reduce the amount of electrical energy required to retain the water temperature. EARLY RETIREMENT In 1975 I had become eligible for early retirement which occurred when one's years of service with the company plus one's age added up to a total of 80. It was 1977 that Lennox announced that it was moving its corporate offices, including the R&D Laboratory to the Dallas area in Texas. Having lived in Detroit and Chicago I did not relish moving to another large metropolis. Lennox made an offer of $10,000 to those employees who chose not to make the move. Lorraine and I decided not to make the move to Texas but rather sell our house in Marshalltown, Iowa and move to Phoenix, Arizona. Now let's to go back to 1960 to catch up to my private life Don, the last addition to our family, had been born in 1959 We had also added SaRuDi, our boat, to the family. SaRuDi was a 16 foot Dunphy Wayfarer with a convertible top and could sleep two adults under the front deck. It had twin 40 horsepower outboard motors. This opened many new horizons for us on week ends and vacations. This stair-step picture, from right to left, shows Sara 13, Rob 10, Ruth Ann 7, Art 6, Diane 2 and Don six months. To haul this gang around and to pull the boat, I had purchased a Ford station wagon. I designed and had built a large aluminum storage pod to mount on the roof of the station wagon. It was 4 ½ feet wide with a rounded aerodynamic front end. Doors on both sides provided access to store all of our camping gear. This picture, taken at our city park campground shows our boat, station wagon with pod on top and our wall tent. Along with tents and all the camping paraphernalia required, we were loaded for adventures on land and on water. I constructed a camping kitchen that, when closed, held all of our dishes and cooking equipment. Three tents, one a wall tent that could sleep three, two in a double deck folding bunk and two smaller tents plus the back of the station wagon accommodated all of us. What a sight we must have presented when arriving at a campground and setting up housekeeping. By this time I had earned three weeks of vacation each year. On weekends and for short camping vacations we had Clear Lake and Lake Okabojie, just two or three hours drive from Marshalltown. No one was ever left at home. For longer vacations such as in Peninsula State Park near Green Bay, Wisconsin or Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri we took along only the four oldest and left the little ones in the care of Grandma and Grampa Holt. Sometimes I would take Sara and Rob to the Mississippi River for sandbar camping, cruising and water skiing. Wife Ruth could not swim and was not that much for water sports so didn't mind staying behind with the little ones. Our favorite spot for longer, three week, vacations was a campground on Lake of the Ozarks. Everyone went. A quiet bay was adjacent to the campground for fishing and floating on air mattresses. There were docks for the boats and a gas dock to refuel and for temporary mooring. To the delight of all of the kids, were the other camping families with similar aged kids next to us. With our group, we always had older ones to play with and keep an eye on the younger ones. Couples without children just loved to visit with and swim with the little ones and teen agers. One gentleman neighbor taught our Ruth Ann how to fish. There was enough shallow water for just lazy wading and water games. The boat seemed to be always up and running. I spent hours pulling Sara and Rob on water skiis and also their friends. Our, off the main channel, large bay was perfect for water skiing or surfboarding behind the boat. While I idled the boat along, Rob just loved to dip the surfboard nose down and skim along the bottom of the bay. One day I looked out from the gas dock as a camping neighbor man went by, water skiing, with Rob sitting on his shoulders.. One year I decided to take just Sara and Rob on a tour of the Mississippi River from the Hudson on the St. Croix River, just below Minneapolis where the St. Croix joins the Mississippi River down to Dubuque, Iowa, 228 miles down the Mississippi. The week before our trip, I pulled the boat to Hudson and parked it in a marina. While there, I decided to take SaRuDi out for a spin just to check out the motors. Suddenly, one motor started to cough and then quit. When I opened up the motor I discovered that an invoice for work I'd had done in the fall had gotten sucked into the air intake. What a way for my mechanic to invoice me!! Now I returned home satisfied with the operation of the motors. Then a week later, Sara and Rob and I caught a ride to Hudson with a friend who was driving to Minneapolis. We first decided to explore the St. Croix, going upstream away from the Mississippi. The first evening we sand bar camped with a group of boats and people that belonged to a private club. They invited us to join them. We were beached next to a big yacht. That night all hell broke loose in the yacht. It seems that the owner, a big burly guy, got in a fight with his little slip of a wife. She must have thrown all of their dishware at him. Well, he came out of that boat with his tail between his legs. Others in the group apologized to us. We did have some good visits with that gang of yachtsmen. Then we headed farther upstream. Suddenly we ran aground right in the middle of the wide channel. I didn't know which shore to head toward to find the deep channel water. I had Sara and Rob put on their life jackets and with a life line from the boat, I had each one walk toward opposite shores until one or the other got waist high in water. Sara won out. Then we headed back upstream until we discovered a campground along the shore. I went ashore to register in and pitch our tent. The lady said that we couldn't park our car in the only camp site they had left because of mud in the parking place. I told her that was OK since we came by boat. She looked surprised and then said \"Boy are you lucky\". I asked her why and she said that we had just come over a series of rapids at that location in the river. The next day we slowly exited the area downstream with our two motors tilted part way up and kind of drifted with the current until we were clear of the rapids. Whew!! Later we were just drifting along, enjoying the scenery when a Labrador Retriever jumped in the river from a cottage and swam over to our boat. After a bit of petting and visit with him we headed back downstream and he swam back home. We finally got back downstream to Prescott, Minnesota, at the junction with the Mississippi' and had a well deserved lunch at a marina restaurant. Then we entered the Mississippi River going downstream. I brought out the book of Upper Mississippi River Navigation Charts which is issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers and explained them to Sara and Rob. This book of 130 charts covers the Mississippi River from the confluence with the Ohio River (mile 1) at Cairo, Illinois up through Minneapolis, Minnesota (mile 868). The lights, buoys and day marks all along the way have a mile mark placard with the miles and tenths of miles listed from mile 1 to mile 868. The scale of these charts is such that each mile on the chart is two inches long. The cities and towns along the way are in such detail that the streets are named."
